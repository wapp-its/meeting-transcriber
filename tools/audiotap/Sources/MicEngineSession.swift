/// Everything in the microphone path that touches `AVAudioEngine` or CoreAudio,
/// behind a protocol so the rest of `MicCaptureHandler` can be tested without
/// audio hardware.
///
/// Two reasons this seam exists, and only the second one is about tests:
///
/// 1. A session is exactly one engine's lifetime. A restart after a device
///    change discards the old session and builds a new one, which is what the
///    code already did by replacing the `AVAudioEngine` instance; naming it
///    makes the boundary explicit.
/// 2. The bring-up calls can block forever: `hardwareFormat`, `installTap` and
///    `start`. `hardwareFormat` is the one that wedged in issue #588. On a fresh
///    engine it loops inside AVFAudio when the default-device aggregate still
///    references a Bluetooth device that just vanished, and it cannot be
///    cancelled. Isolating those calls lets a test substitute a session that
///    blocks on demand, and lets the handler reason about "an attempt may be
///    stuck in here" in one place.
///
///    `teardown` is deliberately NOT in that class, and that assumption is
///    load-bearing: it runs on the main queue, exactly as `stop()` always has,
///    against an engine whose IO unit is already built, so it does not take the
///    path that loops. If it could block forever, running it on main would
///    reintroduce the freeze this whole design exists to prevent.
///
/// The CI runner has no input device at all, so no test may ever construct a
/// real session. That is a hard constraint, not a preference: reading
/// `AVAudioEngine.inputNode` on an input-less host raises an uncatchable
/// NSException.
