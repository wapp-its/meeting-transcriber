    /// is left rather than proving it gone. An aggregate that has already run a
    /// cycle survives the same change with a fraction of a second of loss, which
    /// is why moving the flip ahead of the tap is the repair.
    ///
    /// Stated to the evidence, which is narrower than the story but points at
    /// the same repair. The diagnostics log attached to issue #693 holds eight
    /// recordings from one machine, seven of them reporting the rate their
    /// aggregate was created at:
    ///
    /// - Five were created at 24 kHz with the microphone side already reading
    ///   24 kHz, and every one delivered its first callback 37 to 50 ms later.
    /// - Two were created at 48 kHz while the microphone side already read
    ///   24 kHz. Neither ever delivered a buffer: no `Audio format:` line at
    ///   all, and `lastBufferAge=never` at stop.
    ///
    /// So the failures are not "a rate change arrived late". They are the
    /// aggregate being built against a device that was mid-transition, its
    /// output side still reporting A2DP while its input side had already moved
    /// to the call profile. That is why opening the microphone first is the
    /// repair: it drives the transition before the aggregate is created rather
    /// than underneath it.
    ///
    /// What this does NOT establish. Those five healthy runs were already fully
    /// in the call profile before the recording began, so they show which
    /// configuration survives, not that this order produces it. One machine,
    /// one session. And the survivor with a measured flip (the 2026-09-11
    /// excerpt) transitioned while its aggregate was already cycling, losing
    /// 0.32 s: that recording's `Mic: engine configuration changed` lands 194 ms
    /// after `Mic recording started`, which is the same event as the 836 ms
    /// measured from its first callback, not a second data point.
    ///
    /// The residual this leaves. A healthy first callback is 30 to 60 ms, but
    /// the slowest on record is 0.78 s (`NoFirstBufferProbeSchedule`), so a
    /// transition that begins after the aggregate is created can still land
    /// before its first cycle. The reading that settles it on any recording is
    /// the rate on `Created aggregate device` against the rate on `Mic hardware
    /// format`, plus whether an `Audio format:` line follows at all. On a
    /// transition invisible to the microphone side, `Measured rate … differs
    /// from cached` is the only place it shows.
    ///
    /// Three costs, accepted rather than fixed here. A slow first microphone open
    /// now delays app capture by that much, and since a *first* start is bounded
    /// by no deadline (only restarts are, issue #588), a microphone open that
    /// wedges now prevents app capture outright where it used to leave a running
    /// tap behind it. A device change mid-recording restarts the two channels
    /// independently, so the same race stays reachable there. And an app-only
    /// recording opens no microphone at all, so the ordering buys it nothing:
