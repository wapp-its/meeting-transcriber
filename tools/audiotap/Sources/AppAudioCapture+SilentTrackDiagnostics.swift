/// The log call sites for the silent-track instrumentation (issue #672), split
/// from `AppAudioCapture.swift` to stay under the 600-line lint cap, and kept
/// together so the wording and the privacy annotations are readable in one
/// place.
///
/// **Why these lines are not gated on verbose logging.** The library's
/// convention is that per-buffer forensics are gated and that one triage line
/// per recording is not: the existing `App audio tap: N PID(s)` line is
/// unconditional precisely so a silent-track report can be triaged without the
/// user having turned Verbose Audio Logging on beforehand, which they cannot do
/// retroactively. A run of exact zeros is that same kind of event, and it is
/// bounded: two lines per process at start and stop, plus at most
/// `SilentTrackObserver.maxEdgesPerRecording` edges. The 5 s cadence line stays
/// gated, because 720 lines an hour is not a triage line.
///
/// **Privacy.** These carry pids, executable names, booleans, CoreAudio object
/// ids and status codes. Executable names are already logged unconditionally by
/// `startCapture` for the same triage reason. Bundle ids and device names are
/// gated elsewhere in this file's neighbours and stay out of here entirely, and
/// no path is interpolated anywhere, so the username-in-a-path leak does not
/// apply.
