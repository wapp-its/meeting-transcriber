/// Phase machine that bounds a *single* capture-restart attempt (issue #588).
///
/// Why this exists: a restart attempt can enter an unbounded loop inside AVFAudio
/// and never return. `-[AVAudioEngine inputNode]` on a fresh engine loops in
/// `AVAudioIOUnit_OSX::_GetHWFormat` when the per-process default-device
/// aggregate still holds dangling sub-device references to a Bluetooth device
/// that just vanished. The call cannot be cancelled, and in the field it returned
/// only when the device came back three hours later.
///
/// `CaptureRestartRetryPolicy` bounds how *many* attempts are made and is unaffected:
/// a restart that fails is the transient case it was built for. This type bounds
/// how *long* one attempt may take, and it makes the outcome safe if a wedged
/// attempt eventually returns:
///
/// - every attempt carries a generation, and a result whose generation is no
///   longer current is rejected rather than adopted,
/// - once an attempt has timed out, output-file creation is forbidden forever,
///   because the restart path recreates the WAV for writing when it finds no
///   open file, which would truncate the finished recording to zero,
/// - `stop()` learns that it must not touch the engine while an attempt is in
///   flight, since the wedged attempt holds the engine's mutex.
///
/// Pure value type so the whole transition table is unit-testable without an
/// engine, following `OutputDeviceChangeCoordinator` and `CaptureRestartRetryPolicy`.
