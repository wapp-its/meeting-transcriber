/// facts about the user and deserve different re-prompt behaviour (issue #543).
/// Collapsing them into a `Bool` meant an unanswered prompt — the normal case
/// for anyone who stepped away, and the *only* case before the prompt could
/// break through Focus — was recorded as a deliberate refusal.
///
/// Only `.granted` starts a recording. The distinction exists purely for
/// `BrowserConsentPolicy`, which suppresses the next question for longer after
/// a real refusal than after silence.

    /// with the cooldown and this does not — it goes on `ConsentDenyList`

    /// re-prompt ten minutes later, which is the thing the user just said no to.
