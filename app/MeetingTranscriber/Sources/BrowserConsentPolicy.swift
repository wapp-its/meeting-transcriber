/// re-detects the same meeting every few seconds; the policy is asked *before*
/// prompting so a decline suppresses re-prompts for `cooldown` seconds instead
/// of spamming. Value type with an injected `now` so it is deterministically
/// testable (pattern: `WatchLoopEndPolicy`, `ManualRecordingMonitorPolicy`).
