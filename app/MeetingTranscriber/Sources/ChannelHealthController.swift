/// Owns the per-channel + symmetric-silence detection that drives the menu-bar
/// red-tint indicators while recording.
///
/// Extracted from `AppState` as a concern-specific controller (see the AppState
/// god-class split). `AppState` holds it as a sub-controller, wires `start()` /
/// `stop()` to `WatchLoop` state transitions, and exposes the observable flags
/// to the menu-bar icon + RPC snapshot.
///
/// Two sibling state machines run off one 10 Hz poll:
/// - `ChannelHealthMonitor` — asymmetric silence (one channel dead while the
///   other carries speech), drives `micSilentActive` / `appSilentActive`.
/// - `SilentRecordingMonitor` — symmetric silence (both channels dead), the case
///   the asymmetric monitor intentionally ignores, drives `recordingSilentActive`.
///
/// The `debounceSeconds` / `indicatorEnabled` closures read live from settings;
/// `recorderProvider` is passed to `start()` (not stored at init) so the
/// controller never holds an `AppState` back-reference. This keeps the polling
/// + notification logic testable against a mock recorder without a `WatchLoop`.
