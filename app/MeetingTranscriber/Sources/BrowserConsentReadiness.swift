/// Whether the recording consent prompt can actually reach the user.

/// A detected meeting asks before it records, unless its app records without
/// asking, and browser meetings always ask (issue #503): detection parks a
/// prompt and waits for an answer. Named for the browser feature that
/// introduced the prompt; it now covers every app that asks. That prompt is a
/// `UNUserNotification`, which makes the notification permission a hard
/// dependency of recording those meetings rather than a nicety. With
/// notifications denied the failure is silent and total: detection fires, the
/// prompt parks where nobody can see it, it times out as a decline after
/// `NotificationManager.consentPromptTimeout`, a cooldown starts, and the cycle
/// repeats forever while watching still reads as on.
///
/// Authorisation is not the whole question, and treating it as the whole
/// question is what let the original field report through (issue #543): that
/// user was `.authorized` throughout. `NotificationVisibility` carries the rest
/// of the settings that decide whether the prompt is actually seen.
///
/// Nothing else in the app notices. `NotificationManager.canDeliver` only checks
/// that an app bundle exists, `PermissionHealthCheck` covers microphone, screen
/// recording and accessibility, and warning the user with a notification would
/// be self-defeating. Hence a Settings-side warning, decided here so the rule is
/// testable without a notification centre.
