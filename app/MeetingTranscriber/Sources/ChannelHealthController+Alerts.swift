    /// What the user can actually do about each failure.
    ///
    /// The app channel used to get one message for both of its faults, on the
    /// reasoning that a tap delivering nothing and a tap delivering zeroes call
    /// for the same checks. That reasoning was wrong in the case it matters
    /// most, and `everCarriedSignal` is what tells the cases apart.
    ///
    /// The asymmetry it rests on: a tap that is not allowed to hear the app
    /// returns `noErr` and then delivers zeroes from its very first buffer and
    /// never anything else (issue #524, and there is no preflight API for that
    /// grant, so nothing else can rule it in or out). It follows that a channel
    /// which carried real audio and *then* went to zeroes cannot be a
    /// permission problem, and sending that user to the Screen Recording pane
    /// costs them the time it takes to find nothing wrong there. It also
    /// follows that a channel silent since the first buffer very well might be,
    /// so that message keeps the pane and the interception check.
    ///
    /// Buffers stopping altogether is a third thing again, and the honest thing
    /// to say about it is less than it is tempting to say. What was measured for
    /// issue #524 is a tap denied from the start: it delivers zeroes, not
    /// nothing. Whether revoking the grant *mid-recording* stops the IOProc is
    /// not established, and `ChannelFault.noBuffers` still lists it as a
    /// possible cause, so that message claims neither way. It names the one
    /// remedy a user can apply instead.
    ///
    /// That message also carries no "while the microphone is still recording"
    /// clause. `digitalSilence` needs corroboration from the other channel
    /// before it is reported at all, so the clause would be true there by
    /// construction; `noBuffers` is reported unconditionally, and in an app-only
    /// recording (`RecordingSource.appOnly`) there is no microphone, which made
    /// the clause plainly false.
    ///
    /// **What to do comes before why.** A notification banner shows the first
    /// line or two and truncates the rest, so a message that diagnoses at length
    /// and only then names the remedy hides the one thing the reader can act on.
    /// Each actionable app arm therefore reads: what happened, what to do, and
    /// only then the reasoning.
    ///
    /// **The lever needs an address.** "Switch the system output device" sends
    /// the reader to the picker in front of them, which during a call is the
    /// meeting app's own, and that one cannot work: the rebuild is triggered by
    /// a change of `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice`, which an output
    /// chosen inside another app does not touch. A field report has it both
    /// ways in one call, the attempts made in the meeting app's picker leaving
    /// the tap dead and the one made in Control Center recovering it, so both
    /// halves are named: where it does work, and where it does not.
    ///
    /// **`noBuffers` claims nothing about the past.** The monitor reads
    /// `ages.secondsSinceLastBuffer ?? elapsedSinceStart`, so this fault covers
    /// a channel that never delivered a single buffer exactly as it covers one
    /// that delivered and then stopped. The never-started case is not the rare
    /// one: it is the whole of issue #693, where the aggregate is created, the
    /// start returns `noErr` and the IOProc never runs. Both messages therefore
    /// state the present. The one arm where a past delivery is guaranteed is
    /// `digitalSilence` with `everCarriedSignal` true, and that is the only one
    /// that says so.
    ///
    /// **One switch, not "and back".** Switching back rebuilds the tap a second
    /// time, and a rebuild can land in the same failing window the first one
    /// did: in that same report a freshly started capture failed identically to
    /// the one before it, with nothing changed. Living with the other output
    /// device for the rest of the call is the smaller cost.
    ///
    /// The microphone's two messages ignore the flag. A device that stopped
    /// answering and a device that is muted are different things to go and fix,
    /// and neither depends on what the channel carried earlier.
