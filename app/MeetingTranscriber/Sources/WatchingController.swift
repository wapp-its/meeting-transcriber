/// Owns the watching / recording lifecycle: the active `WatchLoop`, the
/// auto-detect toggle, manual recording start/stop, the per-recording recorder
/// factory (which installs live-transcription sinks), and the state-change
/// handler that drives channel-health monitoring + error notifications.
///
/// Extracted from `AppState` as a concern-specific controller (see the AppState
/// god-class split). Unlike the earlier leaf controllers, watching is a hub: it
/// reaches across the already-extracted siblings — `pipeline` (to rebuild/ensure
/// the queue and pass it to the loop), `channelHealth` (start/stop on state
/// transitions), `permissions` (seed the loop's permission checker), and
/// `liveTranscription` (attach live sinks to each recorder). It holds those
/// siblings as direct references (not an `AppState` back-reference) since they
/// are all constructed before this controller in `AppState.init`.
///
/// Testability seams: `ensureMicAccess` + `makeDetector` are injectable (default
/// to the production `Permissions.ensureMicrophoneAccess` / `PowerAssertionDetector`)
/// so `toggleWatching` can be exercised without real TCC or IOKit. `syncEngines`
/// is wired post-init via `activate(syncEngines:)`: it bridges to
/// `EngineController.syncEngineSettings()` (held by `AppState`, not injected
/// here as a sibling) and the closure must capture `self` after stored-property
/// init — the same post-init wiring idiom the other controllers use.
