    ///   check whose microphone arm opens the real input device. Under
    ///   `swift test --parallel` that is several forked processes probing the
    ///   HAL at once, and it intermittently comes back denied, which the start
    ///   then correctly refuses.
    /// - Parameter makeRecorder: defaults to a `MockRecorder` carrying a mix
    ///   path, so a stop through it takes the success path. Nothing built here
    ///   touches real audio hardware, because `DualSourceRecorder` writes into
    ///   `AppPaths.recordingsDir` — the production staging directory that orphan
    ///   recovery scans. Real `.micOnly` capture is the live lane's job, not a
    ///   unit test's; see the `e2e-architecture` skill.
    /// - Parameter notifier: pass one to assert on the refusals this controller
    ///   reports. A silent refusal is the failure mode several of its guards
    ///   exist to avoid, so "was the user told" is part of the behaviour, not a
    ///   detail. Defaults to a fresh spy when a test does not care.
    ///   Any `AppNotifying` spy works; a test that needs more than titles and
    ///   bodies brings its own.
    /// - Parameter channelFaultWindow: the channel-health window. Zero (the
    ///   default) lets the first tick decide; see
    ///   `WatchingControllerChannelFaultTests` for when that is not enough.
