// The `RecordingProvider` doubles, split out of `TestHelpers.swift` when that
// file reached the 600-line cap. `ThrowingRecorder` lives here rather than in a
// file of its own because the two stand in for the recorder at the same seam: a
// test picks between them by which outcome it needs, a stop that completes or a
// start that cannot open.

/// A `MockRecorder` that can complete a stop. Without `mixPath` its `stop()`
/// throws `noAudioData`, which is the *lost recording* path, not the happy one —
/// a test that means to exercise a clean stop and forgets this pins the wrong
/// behaviour as correct.
