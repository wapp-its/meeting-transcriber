/// End-to-end coverage for Phase 1 of issue #165: Sortformer mode must
/// now populate `DiarizationResult.embeddings` via post-hoc WeSpeaker
/// extraction on overlap-excluded frames. Before this PR the field was
/// nil in Sortformer mode and `PipelineQueue.processNext()`'s naming-flow
/// `guard let embeddings else { break }` aborted (issue #109).
///
/// Acceptance principle (matches the channel-health E2E pattern from
/// `feedback_e2e_must_exercise_production_chain`): revert the
/// `extractSortformerEmbeddings` call in `FluidDiarizer.runSortformer`
/// and these tests must fail.
///
/// Gated via `RUN_QUALITY_TESTS=1` because the first run pulls the
/// `pyannote_segmentation` + `wespeaker_v2` CoreML models (~150 MB).
/// Subsequent runs are model-cached and complete in ~5 s on M-series.
///
/// Nemotron 3 mode runs the same extraction on its own timeline (an
/// 8-speaker streaming Sortformer at 10 ms frames), so it carries the same
/// contract; the Nemotron case additionally pulls its ~200 MB model.
