/// The wiring between a recording that `WatchingController` starts and the
/// capture-fault notification, driven through the controller's own start paths
/// rather than through `ChannelHealthController.applyTick`.
///
/// `ChannelFaultIntegrationTests` proves the controller reports a microphone
/// that delivers nothing once it is ticked. What it cannot show is that
/// anything ticks it: the polling task only exists if the `.recording`
/// transition reaches `ChannelHealthController.start` with a source, it has to
/// find the loop's recorder, and it has to keep ticking until the window has
/// passed. A microphone that never delivered a buffer was not seen to be
/// reported in the field, so both start paths are pinned here with the real
/// polling task.
///
/// The window is small but positive on purpose. With a zero window the first
/// tick decides, and a polling task that ticks once and stops, or one that
/// restarts its clock on every tick, passes exactly like a working one.
///
/// Where this ends: at the `AppNotifying` call. Whether the system then shows
/// the notification is outside what these tests can see.
