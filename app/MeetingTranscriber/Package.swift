        // verifies it against the checksum before linking; no binary lives in
        // this repository. The artifact is genuinely static — the linked app
        // gains no new dynamic-library dependencies (otool -L shows system
        // libraries only).
        // Hosted on a release of our own vendor repository because upstream
        // publishes no macOS artifact at all. Checksum-pinned, so a swapped
        // asset fails the build rather than shipping silently; the exposure
        // that remains is availability, since the asset disappearing breaks
        // `swift build` for everyone including CI. Mirror it before relying on
        // this for a release.
        //
        // Its headers sit in `Headers/CLocalVQE/`, not at the root of
        // `Headers/`, and a rebuild must keep it that way. For a static-library
        // slice xcodebuild stages every artifact's `Headers/*` into one shared
        // `include/` directory, so two xcframeworks with a root-level
        // `module.modulemap` write the same path and the build dies with
        // "Multiple commands produce". FluidAudio started shipping a binary
        // target in 0.15.6 and hit exactly that. `swift build` never noticed,
        // because it passes each artifact's Headers directory as its own `-I`,
        // which is why this can only fail in Xcode and in the analyze lane.
