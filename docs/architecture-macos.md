# Meeting Transcriber — macOS Architecture

## Overview

Native SwiftUI menu bar application that orchestrates meeting detection, recording, transcription, diarization, and protocol generation. Runs a background watch loop (`WatchLoop`) polling for active meetings and implementing a complete end-to-end pipeline.

**Key pattern:** Observable state models (`@Observable`) with PipelineQueue for decoupled post-processing.

## Source Files

### App Entry & UI

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `AppLauncher.swift` | The actual `@main` — a process entry point that makes the one pre-launch diversion decision (e.g. `--localvqe-selftest`) before `MeetingTranscriberApp`/`AppState` construct, since a conforming `App` type cannot intercept its own launch |
| `MeetingTranscriberApp.swift` | UI shell — SwiftUI scenes, windows, NSOpenPanel, NSWorkspace. Observes `.showSettings` / `.closeSettings` / `.showSpeakerNaming` notifications for RPC- and pipeline-driven scene control |
| `AppState.swift` | `@Observable @MainActor` composition root — wires the concern controllers (`engines`, `watching`, `pipeline`, `permissions`, `channelHealth`, `liveTranscription`, `rpcController`) and exposes the derived UI state (badge, status label) rather than owning it |
| `LivenessMarker.swift` | Process-lifetime marker (issue #703): written at launch, touched once a minute, removed by a clean AppKit quit; the next launch reads it as `PreviousExit` to tell a crash, kill or power loss from a quit, which the per-recording marker cannot do for an idle app |
| `PreviousExitNotice.swift` | Wording of the launch-time notification for a run that ended without a quit: the window in which nothing was watching for meetings |
| `MenuBarView.swift` | Menu bar dropdown (state, actions, meeting info) |
| `MenuBarIcon.swift` | Renders the animated waveform icon + badge overlays (permission, record-only, channel-silent) |
| `AppPickerView.swift` | App picker sheet for manual recording of any running app |
| `AudioImportTypes.swift` | File types offered by the batch-import and voice-enrollment `NSOpenPanel`s — single source of truth so the ffmpeg-gated vs. natively-decoded format lists stay pinned and testable |
| `A11yID.swift` | Shared accessibility-identifier namespace — one constant per control, referenced by the view modifier, ViewInspector tests, and the `/ui/press` allowlist |
| `SettingsView.swift` | Settings window — `TabView` shell hosting seven topic-grouped sub-views in `Sources/Settings/` |
| `Settings/GeneralSettingsView.swift` | Mode (Record-only) · Apps to Watch (Teams/Zoom/Webex/Browser/WeChat/Tencent Meeting/FaceTime/WhatsApp) · Detection (Poll Interval, Grace Period) |
| `Settings/AudioSettingsView.swift` | Microphone device · VAD (enabled + threshold) · Per-Channel Indicator |
| `Settings/TranscriptionSettingsView.swift` | ASR engine picker · engine-specific options · model status · Live transcription (PoC) toggle |
| `Settings/SpeakersSettingsView.swift` | Diarization · Mic Speaker Name · Known Voices · Recognition Stats · Experimental Diarization Tuning |
| `Settings/OutputSettingsView.swift` | LLM provider · protocol language · output folder · custom prompt |
| `Settings/AdvancedSettingsView.swift` | Permissions · Diagnostics |
| `Settings/AboutSettingsView.swift` | Version · bundle identifier · build date · ffmpeg status · project link · Updates |
| `Settings/HelpBadge.swift` / `Settings/SettingsHelp.swift` | Reusable "?" help-popover badge + its shared copy, used across Settings sections |
| `Settings/View+RecordOnly.swift` | `recordOnlyDisabled(_:)` view modifier — dims + disables the Transcription/Protocol/VAD/Diarization sections when record-only mode is on |
| `SpeakerNamingView.swift` | Speaker naming dialog after diarization |
| `SpeakerNamingRowState.swift` | Per-row naming-dialog state keyed by speaker label (never row position), held as one `@Observable` object so a chip tap or typed name is attributable to the row it wrote to (issue #700) |
| `NamingGraceKey.swift` | Identity of one keyboard-grace window in the naming dialog — what counts as "a new grace window" (data revision + pending-job count), so the gate re-locks when another job steals focus |
| `KnownVoicesView.swift` | Manage persisted speaker DB (rename, delete, merge) — embedded in `SpeakersSettingsView` |
| `RecognitionStatsView.swift` | Recognition stats display — aggregate counts from `recognition_log.jsonl` |
| `VoiceEnrollmentView.swift` | Voice enrollment sheet — seeds `speakers.json` from an existing audio file |
| `AppSettings.swift` | `@Observable` settings persisted to UserDefaults |
| `AppSettings+Computed.swift` | Values derived from stored `AppSettings` toggles, split out to keep `AppSettings.swift` under the line cap |
| `AppSettings+OutputDirectory.swift` | Everything derived from `customOutputDirBookmark`, split out to keep `AppSettings.swift` under the line cap |
| `AppSettings+Vocabulary.swift` | Custom-vocabulary file selection, sandbox bookmark resolution, and validation state — shared by both ASR engines |
| `LegacyDefaultsMigration.swift` | One-shot carry-over of settings from the pre-rename bundle identifier, since `UserDefaults` is scoped per identifier |
| `UpdateChecker.swift` | Checks GitHub releases for newer versions, drives the menu bar update badge |
| `Settings/PickerLanguages.swift` | Language picker entries for WhisperKit and Parakeet language selectors |
| `LiveCaptionsState.swift` | `@Observable` live-captions state (per-channel hypotheses + finalised utterances) + RPC-wire types |
| `LiveCaptionsOverlay.swift` | SwiftUI caption-bar content (recent finals + per-channel hypotheses) hosted in `LiveCaptionsWindow` |
| `LiveCaptionsWindowController.swift` | Borderless click-through NSPanel hosting the caption overlay (⌥-drag to reposition; origin persisted) |
| `LiveCaptionsSize.swift` | Caption-bar size presets (Small/Medium/Large): font size paired with the fixed panel dimensions that fit it; `AppSettings.liveCaptionsSize` |
| `ProcessingStatsView.swift` | Read-only average per-stage processing durations from `stage_timing.jsonl` (Settings → Advanced) |

### Core Pipeline

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `WatchLoop.swift` | Main orchestrator: detect → record → enqueue PipelineJob |
| `WatchLoop+ManualRecording.swift` | The poll loop that decides when a manually started recording ends, split out of `WatchLoop` |
| `WatchLoopEndPolicy.swift` | Pure decision logic for `waitForMeetingEnd` (grace-period / max-duration) |
| `WatchLoopState.swift` | Value-type snapshot of `WatchLoop`'s observable fields (for tests and RPC) |
| `ManualRecordingMonitorPolicy.swift` | Pure decision logic for manual recording stop conditions (process-died vs max-duration) |
| `MeetingDetecting.swift` | `MeetingDetecting` protocol + `DetectedMeeting` model |
| `MeetingDetector.swift` | Window title polling, pattern matching, confirmation counting, cooldown |
| `MeetingTitleMatcher.swift` | Compiled idle/meeting title regex semantics for one `AppMeetingPattern` |
| `PowerAssertionDetector.swift` | IOKit power assertion–based meeting detection (sandbox-safe); carries the Chrome WebRTC pattern for browser meetings (issue #503) |
| `PowerAssertionDetector+Diagnostics.swift` | "Saw something that looks like a meeting and did not act on it" diagnostic, split out of `PowerAssertionDetector` (line-cap) |
| `MicInputDetector.swift` | Third `MeetingDetecting` strategy: watches which processes hold `kAudioProcessPropertyIsRunningInput` via the Core Audio process-object API — covers call apps (WeChat, Tencent Meeting, FaceTime, WhatsApp) with no reliable power-assertion signal; each app opt-in and off by default |
| `MeetingPatterns.swift` | Regex patterns for Teams, Zoom, Webex, browser (Chrome WebRTC) |
| `BrowserConsentPolicy.swift` | Pure decision logic for the browser-meeting "ask before recording" prompt — decline cooldown (issue #503) |
| `ConsentAnswer.swift` | Three-way outcome of a consent prompt (yes / no / unanswered) — kept distinct from a `Bool` so a decline and a timeout get different re-prompt cooldowns (issue #543) |
| `BrowserConsentReadiness.swift` | Whether a browser-meeting consent prompt can actually reach the user — polls `NotificationVisibility` since the prompt is itself a notification and a broken notification channel can't report its own brokenness |
| `ConsentPromptCoordinator.swift` | Coordinates an async yes/no recording-consent prompt: register pending decision by id, resolve once via answer or timeout |
| `WatchLoop+Consent.swift` | Browser-meeting consent gate, split out of `WatchLoop`; only patterns with `requiresRecordingConsent` reach it |
| `DualSourceRecorder.swift` | Orchestrates AudioTapLib capture + mic, mixes tracks |
| `RecordingProvider.swift` | Protocol abstraction over `DualSourceRecorder` for mock injection in `WatchLoop` tests |
| `WatchLoop+RecordOnly.swift` | Record-only output branch (moves WAVs + writes `RecordingSidecar`), split out of `WatchLoop` |
| `ProtocolResumePolicy.swift` | Decides what the snapshot restore does with a job interrupted mid-run: resume from the saved transcript, just finish, or run in full. Keys on the interrupted stage, never on "a transcript exists", because stage 1 writes a draft without speaker labels |
| `AudioPersistencePolicy.swift` | Decides per finished-job source file whether to relocate it into the output folder or leave it in place (staging-dir recording vs. user-picked import) |
| `TranscribingEngine.swift` | `TranscribingEngine` protocol + `mergeDualSourceSegments` default impl |
| `TimestampedSegment.swift` | A transcribed segment (start/end/text/speaker); every field is `var` so downstream passes (delay shift, VAD remap, block merge) copy-and-mutate instead of a memberwise rebuild that could silently drop a field |
| `WhisperKitEngine.swift` | WhisperKit transcription engine (99+ languages, ~1 GB model) |
| `WhisperKitModelSource.swift` | The three steps `WhisperKitEngine.loadModel()` takes to reach a usable pipeline (locate local, download, load), named so a test can observe which ran |
| `WhisperKitLocalSnapshot.swift` | Locates an already-downloaded WhisperKit model on disk so `loadModel()` can skip `WhisperKit.download`, which reaches huggingface.co before checking for a local copy (issue #736) |
| `WhisperDecodingClient.swift` | Narrow decode boundary used by `WhisperKitEngine` — production forwards to WhisperKit, tests capture the exact options passed |
| `WhisperVocabularyPrompt.swift` | Converts the shared custom-vocabulary file into a bounded WhisperKit decoder prompt (experimental, off by default) |
| `ParakeetEngine.swift` | NVIDIA Parakeet TDT v3 via FluidAudio (25 EU languages, ~50 MB, ~10× faster) |
| `ParakeetTokenGrouping.swift` | Pure token-grouping logic extracted from `ParakeetEngine` (testable) |
| `ParakeetVocabularyConfiguration.swift` | Identity of one Parakeet CTC vocabulary configuration (path + bookmark + file revision) and its preparation lifecycle |
| `VocabularyFileAccess.swift` | Resolves persisted sandbox access for the shared custom-vocabulary/terminology files, brackets reads with the matching security scope |
| `TerminologyNormalizer.swift` | Opt-in post-ASR canonical-spelling rules (`Canonical => variant \| variant`), engine-independent |
| `StreamingTranscriber.swift` | Per-channel live transcription actor (FluidVAD streaming → `engine.transcribeSamples` → partial/final captions) |
| `PipelineQueue.swift` | Decouples recording from post-processing, sequential job pipeline |
| `PipelineQueue+Stages.swift` | Per-stage job processing (transcribe → diarize → naming → protocol), split out of `PipelineQueue` (line-cap) |
| `PipelineQueue+Recovery.swift` | Snapshot restore and orphaned-recording recovery for `PipelineQueue`; also `retryJob`/`canRetryJob`, which puts a failed job back to `.waiting` under its own id after clearing the prior run's naming state, error/warnings and echo verdicts |
| `PipelineQueue+EchoBleed.swift` | Warns when a dual-source recording carries the same speech on both tracks (loudspeaker bleeding into the microphone) — measurement half of the echo mitigation (issue #581) |
| `PipelineQueue+EchoCancellation.swift` | Removes the far end from the microphone track before anything reads it — cancellation half of the echo mitigation, the other branch of `EchoRemedy` |
| `EchoBleedDetector.swift` | Decides `.notMeasured` / `.clean` / `.affected` for a dual-source recording, from per-10s-window envelope correlation between the two tracks |
| `EchoSegmentClassifier.swift` | Per microphone segment, decides whether the app track's energy explains it (`.echoOnly`, suppressed from the transcript) or the local speaker also spoke (`.mixed`/`.ownVoice`, kept) |
| `EchoEmbeddingQuarantine.swift` | Holds mic-track speaker embeddings back from `speakers.json` on an echo-affected recording, so a voice learned from contaminated audio is never folded into a stored centroid |
| `EchoRemedy.swift` | Decides which of the two echo remedies (cancellation vs. transcript dedup) a recording gets — they do not compose |
| `EchoCancelling.swift` | Abstraction seam for acoustic echo cancellation; `LocalVQECanceller` is the concrete implementation |
| `EchoCancellationSelfCheck.swift` | Judges a cancellation run from the canceller's own per-window report — a difference between far-end and no-far-end windows, not a level, so a run that quietly removed nothing is caught |
| `EchoFrameChunking.swift` | Pure hop arithmetic for streaming a signal through LocalVQE's fixed-256-sample-hop frame API |
| `LocalVQECanceller.swift` | `EchoCancelling` implementation over the vendored LocalVQE static library (`CLocalVQE`) — owns the C context lifecycle, drives the streaming frame API hop by hop |
| `LocalVQECanceller+File.swift` | File-to-file half of `LocalVQECanceller` — the shape the pipeline calls |
| `LocalVQEModel.swift` | Resolves the bundled LocalVQE AEC model (`localvqe-*.gguf`) the canceller runs against; refuses to silently fall back when an override path is missing |
| `LocalVQESelftest.swift` | Hidden `--localvqe-selftest` CLI probe proving the statically linked library resolves its compute backend from inside a signed `.app` bundle (`#if !APPSTORE`) |
| `PipelineJob.swift` | Pipeline job model (waiting → transcribing → diarizing → generatingProtocol → done) |
| `DualTrackViability.swift` | Decides per track whether a dual-source recording carries enough audio to transcribe, so an empty microphone or app track fails only that track instead of throwing the whole job (issue #724) |
| `TranscriptNote.swift` | Puts a recording-level annotation at the top of a rendered transcript, applied through `[TimestampedSegment].transcriptText(note:)` so every render (draft, speaker-labeled, late re-diarization) gets it exactly once |
| `PipelineSnapshot.swift` | Pure I/O helpers for persisting `PipelineQueue` jobs to disk (atomic rename) |
| `PipelineEventLog.swift` | Append-only JSONL log of `PipelineQueue` job state transitions |
| `StageTimingStats.swift` | Per-stage wall-clock duration tracking, backs `ProcessingStatsView` |
| `ProcessedRecordingsLedger.swift` | File-backed ledger of mix-file paths that completed the pipeline (dedupes recovery re-processing) |
| `InFlightRunRegistry.swift` | Process-wide record of currently-executing pipeline runs, so a second `PipelineQueue` built while the first is still working can't double-start the same job/audio (issue #558) |
| `SnapshotWriterActor.swift` | Actor isolating pipeline queue snapshot writes (prevents main-actor stalls on macOS 26 rename deadlock) |
| `SpeakerNamingSession.swift` | Collaborator `PipelineQueue` calls for the speaker-naming work still owned by the queue, split out for size |
| `SpeakerNamingSession+Late.swift` | Late-confirm and late re-diarization paths for speaker naming |
| `SpeakerNamingData.swift` | `PipelineQueue.SpeakerNamingData`/`.Segment`/`SpeakerNamingResult` value types, nested under `PipelineQueue` for source compat |
| `SpeakerNamingStore.swift` | Disk persistence for a job's speaker-naming sidecars, keyed by per-job slug; pure I/O, no queue state |
| `SpeakerKey.swift` | Speaker identity in the dual-track pipeline: raw diarizer id + track; single home for the `R_`/`M_` prefix convention |
| `NamingWindowPolicy.swift` | Pins the "Name Speakers" window so it stays available while the user works in other apps (issue #504) |
| `LiveTranscriptionController.swift` | Wires the per-channel live-caption pipeline (streaming or re-transcribe) to both `DualSourceRecorder` sinks (mic + app), feeds `LiveCaptionsState` |
| `LiveTranscriptionController+Nemotron.swift` | Nemotron streaming-pipeline construction, split out for size; injectable factory for testing the build + model-load-failure fallback |
| `LiveTranscriptionCoordinator.swift` | `@Observable` coordinator: builds + arms `LiveTranscriptionController`, feeds `LiveCaptionsState` |
| `LiveCaptionPipeline.swift` | Per-channel live captioning strategy protocol (English EOU streaming \| Nemotron streaming \| WhisperKit/Parakeet re-transcribe) |
| `LiveCaptionsGate.swift` | Pure decision logic for live captions routing: master toggle + explicit engine language (`en` → English EOU streaming, other → Nemotron streaming, auto-detect → re-transcribe or none) — shared by `AppState`, coordinator, and controller. Overlay visibility is a separate UI AND (`overlayVisible`); it is not a strategy input |
| `EouStreamingCaptionSession.swift` | English low-latency streaming caption session via FluidAudio Parakeet EOU, backed by `UtteranceRingBuffer` |
| `NemotronStreamingCaptionSession.swift` | Multilingual (non-English) low-latency streaming caption session via FluidAudio Nemotron |
| `NemotronAsrManager.swift` | Production seam wrapping FluidAudio's Nemotron model + Silero VAD for `NemotronStreamingCaptionSession` |
| `UtteranceRingBuffer.swift` | Rolling 16 kHz sample buffer addressable by absolute ms timestamp (feeds streaming caption sessions) |
| `ModelWarmupQueue.swift` | Serial FIFO gate for model warm-up loads — avoids compiling/loading the ASR engine and live-caption models concurrently at launch |
| `EngineModelState.swift` | App-owned model lifecycle state for a `TranscribingEngine`, decoupled from any ASR vendor's own enum |
| `EngineController.swift` | `@Observable @MainActor` engine selection + model lifecycle controller (language/vocabulary sync, preload) |
| `PipelineController.swift` | `@Observable` controller owning `PipelineQueue` lifecycle (wired by `AppState`) |
| `OutputDirectoryResolver.swift` | Decides a recording's output folder at the two seams that capture it (queue build, record-only write); notifies once per episode when the chosen folder cannot be reached and the default stands in |
| `WatchingController.swift` | `@Observable` controller owning `WatchLoop` lifecycle (wired by `AppState`) |
| `WatchingController+Detectors.swift` | Which detection strategies auto-watch runs, and how the "Apps to Watch" toggles filter them — line-cap split, pure and settings-driven |
| `WatchingController+WatchControl.swift` | The `/v1/watch` control surface: meeting watching as an idempotent resource a remote caller can drive |
| `WatchingController+RecordControl.swift` | The `/v1/record` control surface: microphone-only recording as an idempotent resource a remote caller can drive |
| `WatchStatusDTO.swift` | Wire shape for `GET`/`POST /v1/watch` — the meeting-watching lifecycle as a small, stable projection |
| `RecordStatusDTO.swift` | Wire shape for `GET`/`POST /v1/record` — the microphone-recording lifecycle, same audience as `WatchStatusDTO` (Stream Deck key, Shortcut, shell script) |
| `WavHeaderRepair.swift` | Repairs unfinalized WAV files from crash-interrupted recordings (RIFF/data chunk size fix) |
| `FluidDiarizer.swift` | On-device speaker diarization via FluidAudio CoreML/ANE |
| `FluidDiarizer+SortformerEmbeddings.swift` | Post-hoc WeSpeaker embedding extraction for Sortformer mode — overlap-excluded masks feed `SpeakerMatcher` (DiariZen-style hybrid) |
| `SpeakerMatcher.swift` | Speaker embedding DB + cosine similarity matching |
| `SpeakerMatcher+Logging.swift` | Forensic match-decision logging (pseudonymized speaker names via `String.pseudonymized`) |
| `LiveSpeakerMatcher.swift` | Actor for real-time speaker matching per finalized live-caption utterance; same WeSpeaker CoreML model as batch path; caches mask frame count in `UserDefaults` for fast cold start |
| `StoredSpeaker.swift` | Codable speaker DB entry model (centroid + FIFO embeddings + metadata) |
| `DiarizationProcess.swift` | Diarization result types, DiarizationProvider protocol, speaker assignment (standard + dual-track) |
| `ProtocolGenerator.swift` | Shared protocol utilities: `ProtocolGenerating` protocol, prompts, file I/O, `ProtocolError` |

## State Machine

```
WatchLoop:     idle → watching → recording → watching (enqueues PipelineJob)
PipelineQueue: waiting → transcribing → [diarizing] → generatingProtocol → done (60s auto-remove)
                                                                            ↳ error
```

**Transitions** are observable via `WatchLoop.state` and `PipelineQueue.jobs`, triggering:
- Menu bar icon/label updates
- macOS notifications (recording started, protocol ready, error)

### Menu Bar Icon Animations

`BadgeKind.compute(watchState:queueState:permissionUnhealthy:updateAvailable:)` is the pure function that maps the combined `WatchLoop` + `PipelineQueue` state into one of `BadgeKind.inactive | .recording | .transcribing | .diarizing | .processing | .userAction | .done | .error | .updateAvailable`. `MenuBarIcon.image(badge:permissionOverlay:recordOnlyOverlay:)` then renders the matching animation frame.

| State | GIF | Triggered by | Code path |
|-------|-----|--------------|-----------|
| **Idle** | <img src="menu-bar-idle.gif" width="60"> | `WatchLoop.state == .idle / .watching` and `PipelineQueue` empty | `BadgeKind.inactive` |
| **Recording** | <img src="menu-bar-recording.gif" width="60"> | `WatchLoop.state == .recording` (waveform bars bounce) | `BadgeKind.recording` |
| **Transcribing** | <img src="menu-bar-transcribing.gif" width="60"> | `PipelineJob.state == .transcribing / .recordingDone` (bars morph into text glyphs) | `BadgeKind.transcribing` |
| **Diarizing** | <img src="menu-bar-diarizing.gif" width="60"> | `PipelineJob.state == .diarizing` (bars split into colored speaker groups) | `BadgeKind.diarizing` |
| **Protocol** | <img src="menu-bar-protocol.gif" width="60"> | `PipelineJob.state == .generatingProtocol` (lines appear sequentially) | `BadgeKind.processing` |

The icon is rendered as a SwiftUI `Image` template (auto-tinted by AppKit for light/dark mode) **unless** an overlay applies — overlays force non-template rendering to keep the colored badge intact.

### Permission problem badge

<p>
<img src="menu-bar-permission.gif" width="80" alt="Permission problem badge">
</p>

A red circle with a white "!" is composited in the bottom-right corner by `MenuBarIcon.drawExclamationBadge` whenever `PermissionHealthCheck` reports any of Microphone / Screen Recording / Accessibility as `.denied` or `.broken`. The overlay sits **on top of whatever primary state animation** is currently active — the user still sees what the app is doing while being told something is wrong. See "Permission health check + badge overlay" below for the full health-check semantics.

### Record-only mode badge

<p>
<img src="menu-bar-record-only.gif" width="80" alt="Record-only mode">
</p>

A persistent small red dot in the bottom-right corner indicates that **Record-only mode** is enabled (`AppSettings.recordOnly == true`). In this mode `WatchLoop.enqueueRecording()` moves dual-source WAVs into `<outputDir>/recordings/` together with a `<basename>_meta.json` `RecordingSidecar` and skips the entire post-processing pipeline (VAD, transcription, diarization, protocol). Intended for fleet topologies where macOS clients capture and a separate machine (e.g. a Linux GPU host via Syncthing) processes the audio. The sidecar's `trigger` field (`auto` | `manual`, schema version 2) tells that consumer which call site produced the recording, so it can treat a short auto-detected capture (likely a false trigger) differently from a short deliberate manual one.

Like the permission badge, the dot is rendered as a persistent overlay on top of whatever primary animation is currently active — so the mode is always clearly indicated whether the app is idle, recording, or running anything else. **Precedence:** when both apply, the red exclamation (permission badge) wins, because a permission problem actually breaks recording while record-only is a deliberate user choice.

### Per-channel asymmetric-silence indicator

When one capture channel goes silent while the other is still carrying audio for longer than the configured debounce window, the waveform bars in the menu bar are tinted **red** to surface the half-broken capture at a glance. `MenuBarIcon.image(..., micSilentOverlay:appSilentOverlay:)` paints the **top half** red when the mic channel is the silent one and the **bottom half** red when the app-audio channel is the silent one. When both apply, both halves are red (effectively all-red bars). Like the permission badge, this overlay forces non-template rendering so the red stays red in dark mode.

The flags driving this overlay (`AppState.micSilentActive` / `AppState.appSilentActive`) are flipped by a ~10 Hz polling task that reads `WatchLoop.activeRecorder?.{mic,app}LevelDBFS` and feeds the values into a pure `ChannelHealthMonitor` state machine. The monitor uses two dBFS thresholds — `silenceThresholdDBFS` (-60) and `speechThresholdDBFS` (-50) — with hysteresis: an episode only starts when one channel is below silence *and* the other is above speech, and only resolves when the supposedly-silent side crosses back above the speech threshold. Transient dips into the dead zone between the thresholds (natural pauses between syllables) keep the debounce timer running rather than resetting it.

**Settings → Audio → Per-Channel Indicator** turns the tint on or off (default on); the **Warn after** slider (30–300 s, default 90 s) sets the window. The toggle governs the tint alone: notifications are posted whether or not it is on, because a user who finds the red icon distracting is not asking to be left uninformed about a dead capture channel. The per-channel notification comes from `ChannelFaultMonitor`, which asks whether that channel has stopped delivering (no buffers, or buffers of digital zeroes) rather than whether it is quiet. The symmetric `Recording Appears Silent` still comes from `SilentRecordingMonitor` and its dBFS thresholds, so it remains level-based and can fire on a call in which nobody is speaking; moving it onto the ages needs the gap between the two monitors closed first.

**Precedence ordering** (highest wins, composes over the others underneath):

1. Permission badge (red exclamation) — actually breaks recording
2. Channel-silent tint (red waveform halves) — degraded recording
3. Record-only dot (persistent red dot) — user-chosen mode
4. Primary state animation (idle / recording / transcribing / diarizing / protocol)

## Audio Pipeline

### Capture

```
AudioTapLib (CATapDescription)
├─ Input: App PID → CoreAudio process tap → aggregate device
├─ Output: Interleaved float32 (mono or stereo) → FileHandle (raw PCM)
├─ Mic: AVAudioEngine → mono WAV file (MicCaptureHandler)
└─ Metadata: micDelay, actualSampleRate, actualChannels via AudioCaptureResult
```

**Key:** CATapDescription requires NO Screen Recording permission (purple dot indicator only). Handles output device changes by recreating tap automatically.

**Start order (issue #693):** `AudioCaptureSession.start()` opens the microphone first and the app tap second, and the order is load-bearing. Opening the input takes a Bluetooth headset out of A2DP into its call profile; with the tap opened first, the disturbance landed underneath an aggregate device that had been created and started but had not yet run its first IO cycle, and the tap then delivered nothing for the rest of the recording (no IO callback, zero bytes, no error). Measured with a throwaway probe that is not in this repository: 9 failures in 30 starts with the tap first, 0 in 30 with the microphone first, which bounds what is left rather than proving it gone. **The full argument, including what the order does and does not guarantee and the three accepted costs, is the doc comment on `AudioCaptureSession.start()`; it is kept in one place on purpose.** Downstream, the measured `micDelay` is now normally negative (the microphone leads), which `MicDelayNormalisation` turns into a padded app track and a reported delay of 0; two cases it does not cover are a dual-source recording whose `_mic.wav` turns out unreadable, where the raw negative value is still what gets reported, and a crash-recovered recording, which `DualSourceRecorder.recoverCrashedRecording` rebuilds with a hard-coded `micDelay: 0` and therefore does not realign at all.

**Restart bounding (issue #588):** a device-change restart on either channel can wedge inside AVFAudio/CoreAudio and never return (e.g. `AVAudioEngine.inputNode` looping on a dangling Bluetooth sub-device held by coreaudiod). `RestartArbiter` bounds how long a single restart attempt may run — attempts carry a generation and run off the main queue, so a result from a wedged attempt that eventually returns is rejected rather than adopted. `CaptureRestartRetryPolicy` bounds how many attempts are made and is shared by both channels. A channel that gives up tells the user directly (`AudioCaptureSession`/`DualSourceRecorder` expose which one) instead of only decaying to silence, which the asymmetric-silence detector would otherwise misreport as a routing/mute problem rather than a channel that is gone for good.

**Safari support (issue #524):** the app-audio tap targets processes via macOS's *responsible-process* attribution (`ProcessResponsibility`) as well as bundle-path enumeration (`ProcessTreeEnumerator`) — Safari's call audio comes from WebKit XPC services outside `Safari.app`, unlike Electron/Chrome helpers that live inside their own bundle.

### Processing (DualSourceRecorder.stop())

```
App temp: already 16kHz mono float32 (resampled in-IOProc at capture time)
  → Save app.wav (16kHz mono)
  → Load mic.wav (already 16kHz from MicCaptureHandler)
  → Apply mute mask (zero mic during muted periods)
  → Echo suppression (RMS-based gate, 20ms windows)
  → Delay alignment (prepend zeros by MIC_DELAY)
  → Mix (average tracks)
  → Save mix.wav (16kHz mono)
```

All recordings are normalized to 16kHz at capture time — no resampling needed in the pipeline.

### Echo Mitigation (issue #581)

The RMS-based echo suppression above is a capture-time gate; it does not catch a loudspeaker recording where the remote voices bleed into the microphone track after both tracks are already saved. Two independent, non-composing remedies run in the transcribe stage, decided per recording by `EchoRemedy`:

- **Detection first, always:** `EchoBleedDetector` (`PipelineQueue+EchoBleed.swift`) scores per-10s-window envelope correlation between the app and mic tracks, centred on the recorder's own `micDelay`, and reports `.notMeasured` / `.clean` / `.affected` as `PipelineJob.echo` (surfaced on `GET /v1/jobs/<id>`).
- **Cancellation (off by default):** `LocalVQECanceller`, over the vendored `CLocalVQE` static library, removes the far end from the microphone *audio* before transcription. `EchoCancellationSelfCheck` judges the run from the canceller's own per-window report before its output is adopted.
- **Transcript dedup (opt-in, off by default, and only on an `.affected` verdict):** `EchoSegmentClassifier` decides per mic segment whether the app track's energy explains it; explained segments are marked `suppressed` and left out of the transcript, so the far end isn't written twice. It ships off because a local speaker who only ever talks while the far end does is explained away and removed with them, which `EchoSegmentClassifierTests` pins as an expected failure.
- **Embedding quarantine:** on an `.affected` recording, `EchoEmbeddingQuarantine` holds mic-track speaker embeddings back from `speakers.json`, since a voice learned from contaminated audio would otherwise be folded permanently into a stored centroid.

Full design rationale (why the two remedies can't compose, the model provisioning, and the self-check semantics) lives in `CLAUDE.md`'s Architecture Notes.

## Transcription

### Engine Selection

`TranscribingEngine` protocol abstracts ASR backends. `AppSettings.transcriptionEngine` selects the active engine.

| | WhisperKit | Parakeet TDT v3 |
|---|---|---|
| **Languages** | 99+ | 25 European |
| **Model size** | ~800 MB–1.5 GB | ~50 MB |
| **Speed (M4 Pro)** | ~10–20× RTF | ~110× RTF |
| **Language selection** | Manual or auto-detect | Auto-detect only |
| **Timestamps** | Per-segment | Per-token |
| **macOS** | 14+ | 14+ |
| **Hallucinations** | Can occur | Minimal |

### WhisperKit Engine

- **Model:** `openai_whisper-large-v3-v20240930_turbo` (CoreML/ANE)
- **Pre-loading:** Model downloaded and loaded at app launch (when selected)
- **Lazy fallback:** `ensureModel()` loads on-demand if not ready

### Parakeet Engine

- **Model:** NVIDIA Parakeet TDT v3 via FluidAudio (CoreML/ANE)
- **Pre-loading:** Model downloaded and loaded at app launch (when selected)
- **Token grouping:** `groupTokensIntoSegments` groups per-token timings into sentence-level segments (split on `. ! ?` or 20 tokens)

### Modes

1. **Single source:** `transcribeSegments(audioPath:)` → `[TimestampedSegment]` with start/end/text
2. **Dual source:** `transcribeSegments(appAudio:)` + `transcribeSegments(micAudio:)` → `mergeDualSourceSegments(appSegments:micSegments:)` → `[TimestampedSegment]` merged by timestamp
   - App segments labeled "Remote"
   - Mic segments labeled with user's mic name (default "Me")
   - `mergeDualSourceSegments` is a protocol extension on `TranscribingEngine` — shared by all engines

### Post-processing (WhisperKit only)

- **Token stripping:** Regex `<\|[^|]*\|>` removes `<|startoftranscript|>`, `<|en|>`, etc.
- **Hallucination filtering:** Skip consecutive identical segments

### Custom Vocabulary & Terminology Normalization

- **Custom vocabulary** is one shared one-term-per-line file (`AppSettings.customVocabularyPath`, resolved through `VocabularyFileAccess` for sandbox bookmark access), not per engine. Parakeet always applies it via CTC boosting. WhisperKit applies it only when `AppSettings.whisperKitVocabularyPromptEnabled` (off by default) is on, via `WhisperVocabularyPrompt` turning the file into a bounded decoder-prompt hint — WhisperKit shares its 224-token decoder context between that prompt and generated tokens, so a dense recording can lose whole sentences to it; Parakeet is the recommended engine for vocabulary boosting.
- **Terminology normalization** (`TerminologyNormalizer`) is a separate, engine-independent post-ASR pass, applied to transcript segments right after transcription: opt-in `Canonical => spoken variant | another variant` rules, configured in Settings → Transcribe → Terminology Rules.

## Live Captions (PoC)

Optional in-meeting caption overlay, "Enable live transcription during recording" in Settings →
Transcribe (`AppSettings.liveTranscriptionEnabled`, off by default; enabling downloads a ~0.6 GB
model on first use behind a consent alert). Nested "Show caption overlay"
(`AppSettings.liveCaptionsOverlayEnabled`, default on) hides `LiveCaptionsOverlay` without
stopping the pipeline; `LiveCaptionsState` and `/state.liveCaptions` keep updating.

`LiveCaptionsGate.strategy(liveEnabled:engineLanguage:engineSupportsLive:)` is the pure decision
function — shared by `AppState`, `LiveTranscriptionCoordinator`, and `LiveTranscriptionController`
— that picks the per-channel backend from the active engine's **explicitly configured** language
(not auto-detect):

| Engine language | Strategy | Backend |
|---|---|---|
| `en` | English streaming | `EouStreamingCaptionSession` (FluidAudio Parakeet EOU) |
| any other explicit language | Nemotron streaming | `NemotronStreamingCaptionSession` / `NemotronAsrManager` (FluidAudio Nemotron multilingual) |
| auto-detect (`nil`) | re-transcribe | `StreamingTranscriber` via the active engine's `transcribeSamples`, if supported |
| auto-detect + engine doesn't support live re-transcribe | none | captions off |

Both streaming sessions are engine-independent (they drive their own FluidAudio models directly),
so they're available even when the active `TranscribingEngine` has no live re-transcribe hook.
`LiveTranscriptionController` wires the resolved per-channel pipeline to both `DualSourceRecorder`
sinks (mic + app) and feeds `LiveCaptionsState`, which backs the `LiveCaptionsOverlay` window.
`ModelWarmupQueue` serializes model warm-up loads (ASR engine + streaming models) so they don't
compile/load concurrently at launch.

## Diarization

### FluidDiarizer (On-device)

On-device speaker diarization using FluidAudio (CoreML/ANE). No HuggingFace token or Python subprocess needed. Models downloaded automatically on first run (~50 MB).

Two modes selected via `AppSettings.diarizerMode`:
- **`.offline`** (default) — `OfflineDiarizerManager`, standard speaker segmentation
- **`.sortformer`** — `SortformerDiarizer`, overlap-aware diarization (handles simultaneous speech); speaker embeddings extracted post-hoc via `FluidDiarizer+SortformerEmbeddings` using overlap-excluded WeSpeaker masks

Flow: `FluidDiarizer.run(audioPath, numSpeakers)` → selected diarizer → `DiarizationResult` with segments, speaking times, and speaker embeddings.

**Experimental tuning:** Five `OfflineDiarizerConfig` parameters are exposed in `AppSettings` and editable in Settings → Speakers → Experimental Diarization Tuning: `clusterThreshold` (0.6), `warmStartFa` (0.07), `warmStartFb` (0.8), `minSegmentDurationSeconds` (1.0), `excludeOverlap` (true). All default to FluidAudio community values.

### Speaker Matching

`SpeakerMatcher` matches diarization speaker embeddings against a persistent speaker database (`speakers.json`) using cosine similarity (threshold: 0.40, confidence margin: 0.10). Stores a running-mean centroid (primary match anchor) plus a recent-samples FIFO (max 3, fallback when centroid match is borderline). Quality filter: embeddings from segments shorter than 3 s are excluded from the centroid but kept as fallback samples. Speakers are ranked by recency and use count in the naming UI. Enables recognition of returning speakers across meetings.

### Speaker Assignment

For each transcript segment, find the diarization segment with the longest temporal overlap:
```
overlap = max(0, min(seg.end, dSeg.end) - max(seg.start, dSeg.start))
```
No overlap → nearest-segment fallback by gap distance. Only if no diarization segments exist → "UNKNOWN".

### Dual-Track Diarization

When dual-source recording (app + mic) is available:
1. Transcribe app/mic tracks separately → "Remote" / micLabel segments
2. Diarize app track and mic track separately via FluidAudio
3. `mergeDualTrackDiarization()` — prefix speaker IDs (`R_` for remote, `M_` for local), merge segments by time
4. `preMatchParticipants()` — heuristic assignment of Teams participants to unmatched speakers by speaking time
5. Speaker naming UI — all speakers editable with participant suggestions
6. `assignSpeakersDualTrack()` — app segments matched against app diarization, mic segments against mic diarization

**Single-source fallback:** When only mix audio is available, diarize the mix and use `assignSpeakers()` with nearest-segment fallback.

### Speaker Naming UI

`SpeakerNamingView` shown when diarization finds speakers. Each row shows label, auto-matched name, speaking time, and audio playback. All rows are editable. Supports re-run with different speaker count.

## Protocol Generation

### Provider Selection

`AppSettings.protocolProvider` selects the active provider:
- **`.claudeCLI`** — Claude CLI subprocess (`#if !APPSTORE`)
- **`.openAICompatible`** — Any OpenAI-compatible HTTP API (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, etc.)
- **`.none`** — Skip LLM generation; save transcript only

`AppSettings.includeFullTranscriptInProtocol` and
`AppSettings.saveRawTranscriptSeparately` default to `true` to preserve the
legacy output. Their values are captured when a job enters the queue, so a
later settings change affects only subsequent recordings. The raw `.txt` and
verbatim segment sidecar are deleted only after a job completes successfully
with a saved protocol. If protocol generation is disabled, fails, or the job
ends in an error, the raw transcript is retained with a warning; recordings are
governed by their separate retention policy.

`AppSettings.protocolLanguage` (default `"German"`) is substituted into the prompt as `{LANGUAGE}`. Custom prompts can also use `{MEETING_DATE}` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and `{MEETING_TIME}` (`HH:mm`), derived from the captured recording start time. Imports and recovery jobs resolve those time placeholders to `Unknown` rather than their enqueue or processing time. Only recordings with a captured start receive the authoritative meeting-metadata block, so existing custom prompts receive reliable temporal context without needing to add the placeholders.

### Claude CLI Invocation

```bash
/usr/bin/env claude -p - --output-format stream-json --verbose --model sonnet
```

- **Input:** Meeting metadata + protocol prompt (with variables substituted) + transcript piped to stdin
- **Output:** Stream-json parsed line-by-line (content_block_delta + assistant message)
- **Environment:** `CLAUDECODE` env var stripped to allow nested invocation
- **Timeout:** 10 minutes

## Data Flow

### Observable State Propagation

```
AppSettings (UserDefaults)
  → WatchLoop (@Observable: state, detail, currentMeeting, lastError)
  → PipelineQueue (@Observable: jobs, isProcessing, pendingSpeakerNaming)
    → AppState (computed: currentBadge via BadgeKind.compute(), currentStatus, currentStateLabel)
      → MeetingTranscriberApp (reads appState.*, passes to views)
        → MenuBarView (receives status + callbacks + pipeline queue)
        → SettingsView (receives @Bindable settings)
        → SpeakerNamingView (receives pendingSpeakerNaming data)
```

## Permissions

| Permission | Required For | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Screen Recording | Meeting detection (window titles) | CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo |
| Microphone | Mic recording | AVAudioEngine |
| Accessibility | Mute detection, participant reading | Teams AX tree |
| None | App audio capture | CATapDescription (purple dot only) |

### Permission health check + badge overlay

`PermissionHealthCheck` verifies each of the three TCC permissions by combining the system verdict with a live probe (e.g. `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` returning non-empty window titles for Screen Recording). Each permission resolves to `PermissionStatus.healthy | .denied | .broken | .notDetermined` — `.broken` means "TCC says allowed but the probe disagrees," which happens when macOS hasn't actually wired the permission through and the user needs to toggle it off and on in System Settings.

`WatchLoop` runs the check on startup and `AppState` re-runs it on app activation. When the result is unhealthy:

1. `MeetingTranscriberApp` passes `permissionOverlay: true` to `MenuBarIcon.image(...)`, which composites a red circle with a white "!" in the bottom-right corner over the current badge (`MenuBarIcon.drawExclamationBadge`). This bypasses the cached template icons and renders a non-template image because the overlay must stay red in both light and dark mode.
2. `BadgeKind.compute(...)` returns `.error` when idle-with-problem, so the icon also reflects the problem state when no job is active.
3. A notification is posted via `NotificationManager` with the list of affected permissions (deduplicated — only re-posted when the problem set actually changes).

The overlay lives over the *currently active* animation (idle, recording, transcribing, …) so the user still sees what the app is doing and is simultaneously told "one of the permissions is wrong."

## Settings UI

`SettingsView` is a thin `TabView` shell. Each tab is a self-contained `View` in `Sources/Settings/` owning only the bindings it needs and its own local `@State`. The settings window is resizable (`minWidth: 620, idealWidth: 720, maxWidth: 900`).

| Tab | Sections | Bindings | Local state |
|---|---|---|---|
| **General** | Apps to Watch · Detection | `settings` | — |
| **Audio** | Microphone · VAD | `settings` | `audioDevices` |
| **Transcription** | Engine + per-engine options + status | `settings`, three engines | — |
| **Speakers** | Diarization · Speaker Identity · Known Voices · Recognition Stats · Experimental Diarization Tuning | `settings`, `recognitionStatsLog`, `enrollmentDiarizerFactory` | `knownVoicesSheet` |
| **Output** | LLM Provider · Protocol Language · Output Folder · Prompt | `settings` | `claudeBinaries` (#if !APPSTORE), connection-test state, `availableModels`, `hasCustomPrompt` |
| **Advanced** | Permissions · Diagnostics | — | `micPermission`, `screenRecordingOK`, `accessibilityOK` |
| **About** | Build identity · Dependencies · Updates | `settings`, `updateChecker?` | — |

**Conditional rendering rules:**
- `noMic` hides the mic-device picker (Audio) and the Speaker Identity section (Speakers)
- `diarize` hides the diarizer-mode picker and Expected Speakers stepper
- `vadEnabled` hides the VAD threshold slider
- `transcriptionEngine` switches between WhisperKit / Parakeet option panels
- `protocolProvider` switches between Claude CLI / OpenAI-compatible / None panels
- `#if APPSTORE` removes the Claude CLI provider option entirely
- `updateChecker == nil` hides the entire Updates section in About

**Cross-cutting concerns owned by sub-views:**
- `OutputSettingsView` owns OpenAI-endpoint connection testing (`testConnection()`) and custom-prompt I/O (`openCustomPrompt`, `importCustomPrompt`, reset confirmation)
- `AdvancedSettingsView` owns permission live-probing (`refreshPermissions()`)
- `AboutSettingsView` owns version/build/ffmpeg status and update-check controls

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **@Observable over @StateObject** — Fine-grained reactivity, macOS 14+
2. **PipelineQueue decoupling** — Recording and post-processing run independently; WatchLoop enqueues jobs and resumes watching
3. **AudioTapLib as SPM library** — Direct in-process audio capture via CATapDescription (App Store compatible)
4. **Dual-source recording** — Enables speaker separation without diarization (app=Remote, mic=Me)
5. **Graceful degradation** — Diarization optional, mute detection optional, continues on partial failure
6. **Pre-loaded model** — Selected engine (WhisperKit or Parakeet) loaded at app launch, prevents delay on first meeting
7. **5s cooldown** — Prevents re-detecting same meeting after handling
8. **FluidAudio on-device diarization** — Replaces Python pyannote subprocess, no external dependencies
9. **Dual-track diarization** — App and mic tracks diarized separately, avoiding echo/cross-talk interference
10. **Embedded debug RPC + automation API** — In-process HTTP server (`DebugRPCServer`) exposes state, resource metrics (`GET /metrics`), screenshot, and scene actions for shell-driven inspection and integration tests, plus a versioned `/v1` automation API (headless transcribe + job/naming control, plus idempotent `/v1/watch` and `/v1/record` control surfaces behind Stream Deck/hotkey control; reference in `docs/automation-api.md`). Off by default, opt-in via the `Settings → Advanced → Local Automation API` toggle or the `MEETINGTRANSCRIBER_DEBUG_RPC=1` env var, excluded from App Store builds via `#if !APPSTORE`. Action endpoints route through existing `Notification.Name` observers in `MeetingTranscriberApp`, so RPC-driven flows mirror real menu-bar paths.
11. **No expensive work in SwiftUI hot paths** — view bodies, computed properties read by the body, and per-render closures must not call disk I/O, JSON decode, factory constructors, regex compilation, or other non-trivial work. SwiftUI re-renders on every `@State`/`@Observable` change and fans out aggressively, so what looks cheap once becomes a CPU pin fast. Push heavy values up: store as `@State`, inject as a stored property, or surface via an `@Observable` model. Caches that mirror the underlying source (e.g. `PipelineQueue.knownSpeakerNames` mirroring the speakers DB) must wire invalidation from every mutation site in the same PR — see issue #155 → PR #158 → PR #159 for the cautionary tale.
