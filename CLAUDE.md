## Pipeline

```
Dual-source: AudioTapLib (CATapDescription + AVAudioEngine) → separate 16kHz audio → [WhisperKit | Parakeet] per track → FluidAudio diarization per track (CoreML/ANE) → merge speakers → Claude CLI / OpenAI-compatible API → Markdown protocol
Single-source: Audio/Video → 16kHz mono (AVAudioFile → AVAsset → ffmpeg fallback) → [WhisperKit | Parakeet] → FluidAudio diarization → Claude CLI / OpenAI-compatible API → Markdown protocol
```

## Setup

```bash
# Run menu bar app (builds automatically, including AudioTapLib):
./scripts/run_app.sh
```

## Key Commands

```bash
# Run menu bar app
./scripts/run_app.sh

# Swift tests (parallel — ~1.4× faster than sequential)
# Never pipe a test run into `tail`/`head`/`grep` to shorten it: the shell reports
# the *last* command's status, so `swift test | tail -60` exits 0 on a red suite and
# the truncation hides which test failed. Redirect to a file and read that instead
# (`swift test --parallel > /tmp/run.log 2>&1`), or enable `set -o pipefail`.
cd app/MeetingTranscriber && swift test --parallel

# Swift tests under sanitizers (slow — TSan ~7.5 min, ASan ~4.5 min on M-series)
# CI runs these nightly via cron + on push to main; locally use ad-hoc
# before pushing concurrency-heavy or C-bridging changes.
cd app/MeetingTranscriber && swift test --parallel --sanitize=thread --skip MenuBarIconSnapshotTests
cd app/MeetingTranscriber && swift test --parallel --sanitize=address --skip MenuBarIconSnapshotTests

# Trigger sanitizer matrix on a specific PR/branch via CI
gh workflow run quality-and-safety.yml -f run-sanitizer=true -f run-quality=false

# Lint & format check (dry-run, no changes)
./scripts/lint.sh

# Lint & format auto-fix (SwiftFormat + SwiftLint --fix)
./scripts/lint.sh --fix

# Pre-push parity check (release build — catches Sendable diagnostics
# that debug-mode tolerates; flags App Store variant when --with-appstore)
./scripts/pre-push.sh

# Build self-contained .app + DMG for distribution (Homebrew)
./scripts/build_release.sh

# Run app with debug RPC server enabled (dev-only; binds 127.0.0.1:9876)
MEETINGTRANSCRIBER_DEBUG_RPC=1 ./scripts/run_app.sh

# Build mt-cli (talks to the running RPC server)
cd tools/mt-cli && swift build && .build/debug/mt-cli state

# Live smoketest of the RPC server (kills + builds + launches + asserts)
./scripts/test_rpc.sh

# Build App Store variant (sandbox, no Claude CLI)
./scripts/build_release.sh --appstore --no-notarize
```

## Distribution

Homebrew Cask distribution (stable vs `@beta`), the `v*` tag release workflow, and
the stable-tag ruleset gate → see the `distribution` skill (`.claude/skills/distribution/`).

## Git Workflow

Use the `/git-workflow` skill. Commit proactively after every logical unit of work — don't wait for user permission.

- **Conventional Commits:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, build, ci, revert. CI enforces this on the PR title too (`conventional-title` check); the type list there and here must stay in step.
- **Scopes:** app, test, build, ci, docs
- **Atomic commits:** one logical change per commit. If you need "and" in the message, split it.
- **Stage explicitly:** `git add <file1> <file2>` — never `git add -A` or `git add .`
- **Verify first:** run tests before committing
- **Commit body:** document the WHY for non-trivial changes (architecture decisions, rejected alternatives)
- **Never push to main directly.** Always create a branch, open a PR, and merge via `gh pr merge --rebase --delete-branch`. Only exception: version bumps in `VERSION` file.
- **Rebase merge only.** Squash and merge commits are disabled by repo policy.

## Conventions

- All code and UI text in English
- Protocol output language configurable via `AppSettings.protocolLanguage` (default: German)
- **Plan files:**
  - `docs/plans/` (committed) — RFCs and reference docs for future features that should be visible to anyone reading the repo
  - `docs/plans/.local/` (gitignored) — personal scratch; optional subfolders `open/`, `research/`, `done/`, `future/`, `deferred/`
  - Default to `.local/` for ad-hoc notes, diagnostic dumps, and active finding-trackers; promote to committed `docs/plans/` only when the plan is shared reference material
  - **Never reference `.local/` content in shared artifacts** (PR descriptions, commit messages, code comments, in-app UI, GitHub issues): no file paths under `.local/`, no internal task identifiers like P4/P6/B22/H1/L6, no internal PR-internal nicknames. Reviewers don't see those. Inline the relevant content instead, or describe in plain language. The same applies to chat replies framed as PR/commit-ready text.

## Architecture Notes

**Transcription engines:**
- `TranscribingEngine` protocol abstracts ASR backends. Two implementations: `WhisperKitEngine` (99+ languages, ~1 GB model) and `ParakeetEngine` (25 EU languages, ~50 MB model, ~10× faster).
- `AppSettings.transcriptionEngine` enum (`.whisperKit` / `.parakeet`) selects the engine. Settings UI shows engine picker; engine-specific options hidden when not selected. `availableCases` (filtered by `isAvailable`) is the picker source — a capability hook kept for engines with stricter OS floors.
- Parakeet auto-detects language (no parameter). WhisperKit supports explicit language selection.
- **Custom vocabulary** is one shared one-term-per-line file (`AppSettings.customVocabularyPath`, resolved through `VocabularyFileAccess` for sandbox bookmark access) used by both engines, not a Parakeet-only setting: Parakeet applies it via CTC boosting; WhisperKit applies it only when `AppSettings.whisperKitVocabularyPromptEnabled` (off by default, Settings → Transcribe, "experimental") is on, via `WhisperVocabularyPrompt` turning the file into a bounded decoder-prompt hint — WhisperKit shares its 224-token decoder context between that prompt and generated tokens, and a dense recording can lose whole sentences to it, so Parakeet is the recommended engine for vocabulary boosting.
- **Terminology normalization** (`TerminologyNormalizer`, Settings → Transcribe → Terminology Rules) is a separate, engine-independent post-ASR pass: opt-in `Canonical => spoken variant | another variant` rules, applied to transcript segments after transcription regardless of which engine or vocabulary feature was used.
- **An already-fetched WhisperKit model loads without the Hub.** `loadModel()` asks `WhisperKitLocalSnapshot` first and only downloads when nothing usable is there, because `WhisperKit.download` reaches huggingface.co before it inspects any local file (issue #736). That type carries the full mechanism and the condition under which it can be deleted again. The guarantee has a bound: the locator checks the CoreML bundles, not the tokenizer, which WhisperKit loads from a separate `models/openai/whisper-*` folder and otherwise fetches from the Hub, so a model folder copied in by hand without that cache still fails offline. Two consequences: a complete but stale copy is no longer revalidated on each load, and the normal online path no longer makes a Hub round trip per model file.
- **Custom WhisperKit model** (Settings → Transcribe → Model → "Custom model…"): another Hugging Face repository plus variant folder, or a model folder on disk. `AppSettings.whisperKitModelSelection` resolves it into a variant plus `WhisperKitModelOrigin` (`.hub(repoID:)` / `.localFolder`), and the engine treats the origin as part of the model's identity, because a fine-tune usually keeps its base model's folder name. `whisperKitModel` always stays a stock variant, and an unfinished custom model resolves to it, so a half-typed repository never fails a recording. A Hub origin reuses the local-first path above with its own repo root; a picked folder is never downloaded, so `WhisperKitLocalSnapshot.checkModelFolder` also requires the tokenizer files there, and the folder goes through a security-scoped bookmark like the vocabulary file.
- `EngineController` (`@MainActor`) owns the engine instances + the active-engine selection (`activeTranscriptionEngine`, used by `PipelineQueue`) + the settings → engine language/vocabulary sync (up-front + reactive) + launch model preload. `AppState` exposes it as `engines`.

**Live captions (PoC):** "Enable live transcription during recording" in Settings → Transcribe (`AppSettings.liveTranscriptionEnabled`, off by default; enabling downloads a ~0.6 GB model on first use behind a consent alert). Nested "Show caption overlay" (`AppSettings.liveCaptionsOverlayEnabled`, default on) hides `LiveCaptionsOverlay` without stopping the pipeline; `LiveCaptionsState` and `/state.liveCaptions` keep updating.
- `LiveCaptionsGate.strategy(liveEnabled:engineLanguage:engineSupportsLive:)` is the pure decision function (shared by `AppState`, `LiveTranscriptionCoordinator`, `LiveTranscriptionController`) that routes each channel by the active engine's **explicitly configured** language: `en` → `EouStreamingCaptionSession` (FluidAudio Parakeet EOU), any other explicit language → `NemotronStreamingCaptionSession`/`NemotronAsrManager` (FluidAudio Nemotron multilingual), auto-detect → re-transcribe via `StreamingTranscriber` if the engine supports it, else off. Overlay visibility is a separate UI AND (`overlayVisible`); it is not a strategy input.
- Both streaming backends are engine-independent (drive their own FluidAudio models directly), so captions work even when the active `TranscribingEngine` has no live re-transcribe hook. `LiveTranscriptionController` wires the resolved per-channel pipeline to both `DualSourceRecorder` sinks and feeds `LiveCaptionsState`, which backs the `LiveCaptionsOverlay` window. `ModelWarmupQueue` serializes model warm-up loads so the ASR engine and streaming models don't compile/load concurrently at launch.

**Concurrency:**
- `WatchLoop` is `@MainActor`. Tests for this class must also be `@MainActor`.
- Both engine `loadModel()` methods deduplicate concurrent calls via the shared `SingleFlight` coordinator: a second caller awaits the run already in flight instead of starting its own, and the coordinator re-arms once that run finishes. Safe to call from multiple places. `WhisperKitEngine` guarantees the postcondition, not just one attempt: `loadModel()` ends with the currently requested variant loaded or a reported failure for it, because a load superseded by a variant change would otherwise return with nothing loaded (issue #738). The mechanism and the two rejected alternatives are at the loop in `loadModel`. `ParakeetEngine` has no variant selection and uses `SingleFlight<Void>`.
- `ClaudeCLIProtocolGenerator` uses async process I/O: the process `terminationHandler` yields into an `AsyncStream<Void>` that the caller awaits, instead of blocking on `process.waitUntilExit()`. The stream is installed before `process.run()` and buffers the yield, so an early exit is never missed. stdin/stdout are written/read in detached `Task`s.

**View architecture:**
- `SettingsView` receives its dependencies as stored properties (not `@State`): the engine instances, `updateChecker`, `recognitionStatsLog`, an `enrollmentDiarizerFactory`, the `namingDialogActive`/`pipelineBusy` state flags, and an `onSpeakerMutate` callback.

**Audio loading:**
- `AudioMixer.loadAudioAsFloat32()` uses a 3-tier fallback: `AVAudioFile` → `AVAsset` → `FFmpegHelper` (ffmpeg CLI).
- `loadAudioFromAVAsset()` extracts audio tracks via `AVAssetReader`, outputs 16kHz Float32 PCM. Rescue path only: `AVAudioFile` opens MP4/MOV too on current macOS, so this runs just when tier 1 throws on a non-MKV/WebM file. Its reader is configured like `streamResampleFile` (precise timing, little-endian float, source channels averaged in Swift), each option for a measured trap: an Ogg Vorbis track where `copyNextSampleBuffer()` blocks forever partway through, an AIFF read byte-swapped into NaN, a +3 dB fold against tier 1, and `DiscreteInOrder` decoding to silence with `status == .completed`. Sizing reads the AUDIO TRACK's duration, never the asset's: on a video container whose picture outlasts its sound the asset overstates the audio by seconds. That duration is untrusted (NaN for an indefinite one, absurd for a corrupt field), so the pre-allocation is capped rather than believed.
- `FFmpegHelper` detects ffmpeg binary (env var → `/opt/homebrew/bin` → `/usr/local/bin` → `~/.local/bin` → `/usr/bin`), cached via static let. Converts to 16kHz mono WAV via temp file.
- Both `NSOpenPanel` type lists (batch import + voice enrollment) come from `AudioImportTypes`, not inline literals — the panels are manual-QA-only, so the pure type list is what tests can pin. Only MKV/WebM are ffmpeg-gated; AMR, 3GPP and Ogg (`.opus`/`.ogg`) decode natively and must stay out of `FFmpegHelper.ffmpegOnlyExtensions`, whose members skip `AVAudioFile`/`AVAsset` entirely.
- ffmpeg is optional — install via `brew install ffmpeg`. Status shown in Settings → About.
- **A finished job only relocates audio the app itself produced.** `AudioPersistencePolicy` decides per file: sources inside the staging dir (`AppPaths.recordingsDir`, where `DualSourceRecorder` writes) move into `<outputDir>/recordings`, sources already there stay put (moving would rename them under a fresh stamp and orphan recovery would re-pick them forever), and anything else is a user-picked import that is left untouched. Persisting an import would duplicate a file the user already has for no consumer: re-diarization and late naming read the `_16k.wav` sidecar, while orphan recovery and `ProcessedRecordingsLedger` only scan the staging dir. Consequence to keep in mind: a finished import leaves **no audio at all** in the output folder, only the transcript and the protocol. The 16 kHz sidecars live there while speaker naming is outstanding and `removeNamingData` deletes them once it resolves, so what used to remain for an import was exactly the relocated original. The source staying in the user's folder is now the archive. **A relocated job then carries the new paths.** `PipelineJob.recordRelocatedAudio` is the only writer of the three path fields after enqueue (they are `private(set)`), and the queue wrapper around it writes the snapshot itself rather than waiting for the next state transition: `generateProtocol` returns before its own `.generatingProtocol` transition when no protocol generator is configured, so with `protocolProvider == .none` there would be no transition to ride on. Without this the job named an emptied staging path, and quitting during the protocol call made the restore discard it: no protocol, no job, no notification. **A slot reports the destination only when the file is actually there** (this run moved it, or an earlier run already did); every other outcome, a failed move included, reports the source, because a path nothing can open would land in `ProcessedRecordingsLedger` while the real file waited in staging to be re-picked as an orphan. Consequences: the ledger records the destination for a relocated recording (inert, the orphan scan only reads staging), and the restore's missing-audio rule now fires only on genuinely missing files, failed relocations, and snapshots written before this existed. That rule also logs what it discards now, and rewrites the snapshot so the same dead entry is not re-read and re-logged on every launch.

**Recording:**
- `DualSourceRecorder` uses `AudioTapLib.AudioCaptureSession` directly (no subprocess). App imports the library via SPM local package dependency.
- `DualSourceRecorder` captures `recordingStartTime` in `start()`, not in `stop()`.
- Grace period minimum is 1 second (enforced in `AppSettings.endGrace` setter).
- **Start order (issue #693):** `AudioCaptureSession.start()` opens the microphone **before** the app tap, and the order is load-bearing: opening the input takes a Bluetooth headset out of A2DP into its call profile, and with the tap first that disturbance landed underneath an aggregate device that had been created and started but had not yet run its first IO cycle, leaving the tap delivering nothing for the whole recording (no callback, zero bytes, no error). Measured with a throwaway probe outside the repository: 9 failures in 30 starts with the tap first, 0 in 30 with the microphone first, which bounds the remainder rather than proving it gone. Two consequences in the code: a microphone failure is swallowed when an **app track was requested** (not when an app capture is already running, which after the move it never is), and a failed start removes both output files it created, since an empty app temp is the crashed-recording signature and a stray `_mic.wav` is collected by nothing. **The rest of the argument lives in one place, the doc comment on `AudioCaptureSession.start()`: what the order does and does not guarantee, the three accepted costs (unbounded first start, the restart paths, app-only recordings), and the follow-up all three want.** `micDelay` is now normally negative, which `MicDelayNormalisation` absorbs.
- **Capture-restart bounding (issue #588):** a device-change restart on either channel can wedge inside AVFAudio/CoreAudio and never return (e.g. `AVAudioEngine.inputNode` looping on a dangling Bluetooth sub-device). `RestartArbiter` bounds how long a single restart attempt may run (generation-tagged, off-main-queue) so a wedged attempt can't freeze the app or have its stale result adopted; `CaptureRestartRetryPolicy` bounds how many attempts are made, shared by both channels. A channel that gives up notifies the user directly instead of only decaying to silence, which the asymmetric-silence detector would otherwise misreport as a mute/routing problem.
- **Safari support (issue #524):** the app-audio tap also targets processes via macOS's *responsible-process* attribution (`ProcessResponsibility`), since Safari's call audio comes from WebKit XPC services outside `Safari.app` rather than child processes under its bundle (the existing `ProcessTreeEnumerator` path Electron/Teams use). Resolved via `dlsym` on a private symbol, so it compiles to `nil` under `APPSTORE` — a conscious tradeoff that leaves the sandboxed build without Safari call capture (see Build Variants).
- **App-track capture rate (issue #683):** `AppAudioCapture.resolveActualSampleRate` resolves the rate the tap is captured at from the private aggregate's own properties (`SampleRateQuery.chooseRate`): the nominal rate when it can be read, the requested default otherwise. **The output-stream format never decides on its own**: it corroborates the nominal rate, and its disagreement is a warning, but a lone answer from it falls back to the requested rate, because it is the property that reports a Bluetooth HFP link rate (#82). Both properties are read every time, since the disagreement warning needs both, and the result is logged with its rung on the `Created aggregate device: N, rate … Hz (nominal and stream agree), default 48000 Hz` line. There is deliberately no rung for the tap's own format: a `CATapDescription(stereoMixdownOfProcesses:)` tap reports a fixed 48 kHz at every device rate (measured at 44.1, 48 and 96 kHz), and placed on top it made the two real rungs unreachable. "Requested" is only the fallback: nothing asks the aggregate for a rate, it takes its main sub-device's, so a 44.1 or 96 kHz device is normal and not warned about. Two corrections layer on top: the first-callback `kAudioDevicePropertyActualSampleRate` read (covers creation to first buffer, when a Bluetooth headset may flip profile) and `DeliveredRateTracker` (in-place changes after that). A `Measured rate … differs from cached` warning therefore means the aggregate changed rate between creation and start, not that the device is at 44.1 or 96 kHz. Manual check on a non-48 kHz device: set the output to 96 kHz in Audio MIDI Setup, record one meeting-simulator run, then `log show --last 5m --predicate 'subsystem == "com.meetingtranscriber.audiotap"'`; expect `rate 96000 Hz (nominal and stream agree)` on the aggregate line, no `Measured rate` warning, no tracker `delivering … not the published` line, and an app track the length of the fixture. Restore the device rate afterwards and read it back.
- **Mic channel-map fix:** `MicChannelMap`/`MicConverterFactory` force an explicit channel selection for any mic layout other than mono or plain stereo — `AVAudioConverter`'s implicit downmix silently writes digital silence for most tagged layouts, including 2-channel mic-pair ones (MidSide, XY, StereoHeadphones). The policy is an allowlist, not a discrete-layout special case: anything outside it takes channel 0. Reachable in practice when another app's voice processing switches the built-in mic to a multi-channel array mid-call.
- **Channel fault vs. channel quiet (issue #614):** `ChannelHealthMonitor` (levels, with hysteresis) answers "is this channel unusually quiet compared to the other", the right question for the menu-bar red-half tint but the wrong one for a notification — a muted or simply non-speaking participant is quiet and that is normal call etiquette, not a broken capture. `ChannelFaultMonitor` answers "is this channel still delivering" from the per-buffer ages the capture layer reports (`ChannelSignalAges`) rather than from a level, and drives the "Capture Channel Silent" notification instead. Buffers stopping entirely is reported unconditionally; digital silence (buffers arriving but all-zero) is reported only when corroborated by the other channel still carrying signal, since all-zero samples are also what a healthy channel carries when its source has nothing to say. The tint (levels) and the notification (ages) can therefore disagree by design. **The app channel's message depends on whether it ever carried a non-zero sample in this recording** (`everCarriedSignal`, read from `ChannelSignalAges.secondsSinceLastEnergy != nil`). A tap that is not allowed to hear the app returns `noErr` and then delivers zeroes from its first buffer and never anything else (issue #524, and there is no preflight API for that grant), so a channel that carried audio and then went to zeroes cannot be a permission problem and must not be sent to the Screen Recording pane; one silent since the first buffer very well might be, and keeps that advice. Buffers stopping altogether is a third case, and the honest thing to say about it is less than it is tempting to say: what #524 measured is a tap denied *from the start*, which delivers zeroes rather than nothing, so whether revoking the grant mid-recording stops the IOProc is not established and `ChannelFault.noBuffers` still lists it as a possible cause. That message therefore claims neither way and names the remedy instead. It also drops the "while the microphone is still recording" clause the other two carry: `digitalSilence` needs corroboration from the other channel before it is reported at all, so the clause is true there by construction, while `noBuffers` is reported unconditionally and an app-only recording (`RecordingSource.appOnly`) has no microphone. The two app messages that a user can act on name the one lever there is, switching the system output device, because that is the only thing that rebuilds the tap today. They name **where** to pull it (Control Center, or `SystemSettingsPaths.soundOutput`) and where not to: the rebuild is triggered by a change of `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice`, so an output chosen inside the meeting app's own speaker picker never fires it, and that picker is the one in front of the user during a call. **`noBuffers` claims nothing about the past**, on either channel: the monitor reads `ages.secondsSinceLastBuffer ?? elapsedSinceStart`, so the fault covers a channel that never delivered a single buffer exactly as it covers one that delivered and then stopped, and the never-started case is the whole of #693. Both messages therefore state the present; the one arm where a past delivery is guaranteed is `digitalSilence` with `everCarriedSignal` true, and only that one says so. They also stop at **one** switch rather than "and back": a second rebuild rolls the same dice the first one did, and a field report has a freshly started capture failing identically to the one before it with nothing changed. The microphone's two messages ignore the flag.

**Unclean exit (issue #703):**
- The per-recording marker (`RecordingFileSuffix.inProgress`) only exists while a recording is in flight, so an app that dies while idle leaves nothing behind and the next launch cannot tell a crash from a quit. `LivenessMarker` is the process-lifetime signal: a file at `AppPaths.livenessMarker` written at launch, touched once a minute, and removed by AppKit's termination path (`willTerminateNotification`, observed with no queue so it runs before `terminate` calls `exit`). `AppLauncher.main()` takes it over with `LivenessMarker.arm()`, which inspects and writes in one call (the order is load-bearing and nothing else guards it) and runs before `MeetingTranscriberApp` and with it the heavy `AppState` construction, so a crash inside launch leaves a marker too; `MeetingTranscriberApp.init` then posts `PreviousExitNotice` via `reportPreviousExit` for a marker whose process is gone, once the notification centre is set up. That is `PreviousExit.unclean(lastAlive:)`; a marker naming a live instance of this bundle is `.stillRunning` and stays silent.
- It distinguishes a clean AppKit quit (menu Quit, Cmd-Q, logout, shutdown) from everything else; a crash, a Force Quit, a `kill` (so also every e2e lane's `pkill`) and a power loss all read as unclean, which is the side to err on. Named per bundle identifier because the dev and release builds share `dataDir`. Arm it only from the real entry point: `AppState.init` is constructed by the unit tests, and a marker left by an xctest process would be reported as a crash by the next real launch. The notice is a `.standard` banner on purpose: it reports the past, nothing the user does now recovers the window, and Notification Center keeps it until dismissed; `.timeSensitive` stays reserved for a failure still in progress. Nothing relaunches the app after a crash; that is a product decision not taken yet.

**Detection:**
- `MeetingDetecting` protocol abstracts detection strategies. Three implementations: `MeetingDetector` (window title matching via `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`), `PowerAssertionDetector` (IOKit power assertions — sandbox-safe, no Screen Recording permission needed), and `MicInputDetector` (watches which processes hold `kAudioProcessPropertyIsRunningInput` via the Core Audio process-object API — no extra entitlement, and no window-title polling, so no Screen Recording grant).
- `MeetingDetector` counts each pattern once per poll — prevents over-counting when multiple windows match the same app.
- **`MicInputDetector`** complements `PowerAssertionDetector` for call apps whose in-call power assertions are absent, unnamed, or undocumented (WeChat, Tencent Meeting, FaceTime, WhatsApp): any watched app holding the mic across `confirmationCount` polls is treated as a call, since coverage is traded for precision (a long voice message can look like a call; there's no minimum-duration filter). Each watched app is off by default (`AppSettings.watchWeChat` / `watchTencentMeeting` / `watchFaceTime` / `watchWhatsApp`, additive opt-in) so existing installs see no new auto-recording behavior. Unlike browser meetings these patterns carry no `requiresRecordingConsent`, so a confirmed hit starts recording without a prompt — the reason the opt-in is per app rather than one switch. Once any toggle is on the detector enumerates *every* mic-capturing process each poll, and logs bundle IDs it does not recognise once per session.
- **Browser meetings (issue #503):** `PowerAssertionDetector` also carries a browser pattern that matches the `NoIdleSleepAssertion` named `"WebRTC has active PeerConnections"` (keyword `webrtc`/`peerconnection`, not the assertion type — a Chromium browser holds the same type for plain media playback), so Google Meet / Whereby / web Zoom-Teams-Webex are detected without window titles. The assertion lives in Chromium's content layer, so every fork emits it, and the pattern therefore carries **no process list at all**: `processNames` is empty, the assertion name is the whole signal, and a new fork needs no release. Two consequences follow. First, `PowerAssertionDetector.matches` excludes any process a *native* pattern claims (`MSTeams`, `zoom.us`, ...), computed from `defaultPatterns` and never from the watched subset: Teams is Electron and plausibly holds the identical assertion, so without the exclusion a native Teams call would fire twice, and turning the Teams toggle off would resurrect Teams recording through the browser path. The exclusion is keyed on the process, not the service, which is what keeps web Zoom/Teams/Webex working: taken in a browser they assert under the browser, which no native pattern claims. Second, non-Chromium and Electron apps (Firefox, a Slack huddle) can now reach the prompt; that is the deliberate trade, and the prompt's "Never for this app" action is the filter. `AppMeetingPattern.browserMeetings` is a **category, not an identity** (`appName: "Browser Meetings"`, empty `ownerNames`): each hit synthesises a per-process `AppMeetingPattern` via `meetingIdentity`, so the concrete browser is the identity for the consent cooldown, liveness, tap target, window title and the job/sidecar `appName`. That synthesis MUST carry `requiresRecordingConsent` forward, since `AppMeetingPattern` defaults it to false and a dropped flag would auto-record with no prompt. It is opt-in via `AppSettings.watchBrowserMeetings` (default off, appends the category token to `watchApps`). Because the WebRTC signal isn't meeting-exclusive, browser meetings are gated behind a consent prompt (`AppMeetingPattern.requiresRecordingConsent` → `WatchLoop.requestConsentIfNeeded` → `NotificationManager.askToRecord`, a `BROWSER_MEETING_CONSENT` notification with Record/Ignore/Never actions) instead of auto-starting; a decline suppresses re-prompts for a cooldown (`BrowserConsentPolicy`), and an explicit refusal and an unanswered prompt are told apart: ten minutes of quiet after a no, one after silence, because silence means the user was away rather than opposed (`ConsentAnswer`). **"Never for this app"** is the third answer and the only durable one: it lands on `ConsentDenyList` (persisted as `AppSettings.consentDeniedApps`, reviewable and revertible in Settings → General) and is checked *before* the cooldown, so no elapsed time revives the question. Deliberately a deny list and not a confirmed/denied pair: an approved app still gets the per-meeting prompt exactly as an unknown one does, so a positive entry would carry no behaviour and nothing needs seeding or migrating. **The miss diagnostic** (`unmatchedWatchedAssertionKeys`) reports any process holding a WebRTC-named assertion that produced no detection, whoever holds it; it used to be gated on the same allowlist it was meant to diagnose, which is why a wrong or missing fork name was invisible from the outside. **The prompt is awaited off the poll loop** (`WatchLoop+Consent.swift`): an open question parks in `pendingConsentApp` (also on `/state`) and an answer parks in `approvedConsentMeeting` for the loop to start, so detection keeps running meanwhile. It used to be awaited inline, which stopped `checkOnce()` for up to `consentPromptTimeout` and lost native meetings starting in that window. That is also why the prompt now stays open five minutes rather than one: it blocks nothing, and a minute only ever suited someone sitting at the screen. Accepted and not fixable without a distinguishing signal: Google Meet holds the same assertion on a page you cannot join ("You can't join this video call"), so a stale link parks a prompt about no meeting at all; a title filter would be language-dependent, and the cost is now one prompt rather than a minute of blindness. Audio capture reuses the existing multi-PID tap (Chrome is multi-process like Electron); capturing only the meeting tab vs. all Chrome audio is a known follow-up.
- **The consent prompt makes notification permission a hard dependency of browser meetings.** Denied (or provisional-only) notifications mean the prompt is never seen, times out as a decline, and nothing is ever recorded while the toggle still reads as on. `BrowserConsentReadiness` decides when Settings → General warns about that; the warning lives there and not in `PermissionHealthCheck` because reporting a broken notification channel *by notification* cannot work, and because the permission only matters for this one opt-in feature. Authorisation is not the whole question: an authorised app whose alert style is None, or whose Time Sensitive switch is off, also never shows the prompt, so `PermissionsController.notificationVisibility` polls the whole `NotificationVisibility` (authorisation + alert setting + alert style + time-sensitive + scheduled delivery) alongside the TCC probe, `/state.permissionHealth.notifications*` exposes it, and `scripts/e2e-browser.sh` asserts on it — that lane answers consent over RPC and would otherwise pass on a runner where a real user would see nothing.

**Diarization:**
- `FluidDiarizer` uses FluidAudio (CoreML/ANE) for on-device speaker diarization — no HuggingFace token needed. Two modes: `.offline` (default) and `.sortformer` (overlap-aware, via `SortformerDiarizer`). Selected via `AppSettings.diarizerMode`.
- **Dual-track diarization:** App and mic tracks are diarized separately. Speaker IDs are prefixed (`R_` for remote/app, `M_` for mic/local), merged, and assigned via `assignSpeakersDualTrack`. Single-source recordings fall back to diarizing the mix with `assignSpeakers`.
- **Sortformer post-hoc embeddings:** `FluidDiarizer+SortformerEmbeddings.swift` extracts per-speaker WeSpeaker embeddings after Sortformer diarization (DiariZen-style hybrid), using overlap-excluded masks so mixed-speaker frames don't contaminate centroids. Enables `SpeakerMatcher` recognition when using the Sortformer mode.
- `SpeakerMatcher` stores speakers in `speakers.json` with a running-mean **centroid** (primary anchor) plus a recent-samples FIFO (max 3, fallback when centroid match is borderline). Quality filter: embeddings from segments shorter than `minSpeakingTimeForCentroid` (3 s) are kept as fallback samples but excluded from the centroid. Threshold 0.40, confidence margin 0.10. Legacy entries without a persisted centroid compute `meanEmbedding(embeddings)` lazily until the next confirmation seeds a real centroid.
- **Live speaker matching:** `LiveSpeakerMatcher` (actor) matches finalized live-caption utterances against `speakers.json` in real time using the same WeSpeaker CoreML model as the batch pipeline — voices enrolled post-meeting are recognised in subsequent live sessions without re-enrollment. Cold-start optimisation: caches the WeSpeaker mask frame count in `UserDefaults` so only the embedding model is loaded on subsequent launches.
- **Experimental diarization tuning:** `AppSettings` exposes five `OfflineDiarizerConfig` knobs (`clusterThreshold`, `warmStartFa`, `warmStartFb`, `minSegmentDurationSeconds`, `excludeOverlap`) editable via Settings → Speakers → Experimental Diarization Tuning. All default to FluidAudio community values; a reset button restores defaults.
- `DiarizationProvider` protocol enables mock injection in tests.

**Echo bleed (issue #581):** a dual-source recording made on loudspeakers carries the remote voices on the microphone track as well. The two tracks are transcribed separately and `DiarizationProcess.mergeDualSourceSegments` interleaves them **without any dedup**, so every affected utterance lands in the transcript twice; the mic-track diarization also sees the bled-in voice, which pollutes the speaker list and can fold a foreign voice into a stored centroid.
- `EchoBleedDetector` is the pure decision type, called from the transcribe stage after both tracks are resampled and before either is transcribed (`PipelineQueue+EchoBleed.swift` wires it; the work runs off the main actor because `PipelineQueue` is `@MainActor` and decoding two ten-minute tracks on it would block the UI).
- **The metric is the share of 10 s windows above a per-window envelope correlation of 0.7, not a correlation over the file.** A whole-file correlation dilutes partial bleed (a reproduced echo recording measured 0.92 inside its echo phases and 0.657 across the file), and the window *maximum* is unusable because clean recordings reach 0.3 to 0.55. Thresholds come from 86 real dual-source pairs: affected recordings sat at 34/60/77 %, one borderline case at 4 %, twenty clean ones at exactly 0 %.
- Envelopes rather than waveforms, because the two capture chains always differ in gain and frequency response. The lag search is **centred on the recorder's `micDelay`**, not on zero: the two files' sample 0 are not simultaneous, and a mic that starts later than the search window (a Bluetooth device spinning up) would put real bleed outside it and read as clean.
- A verdict needs a minimum number of scored *and* affected windows, not just a share. With one scored window the share is quantised to 0 % or 100 %, and the corpus shows even clean recordings throw isolated hot windows.
- Reported on two channels, deliberately: a human sentence in the job's `warnings`, and the structured `echo` object on `GET /v1/jobs/<id>` (`detected`, `affectedWindowShare`, `windowsScored`, `windowsAffected`, `suppressedSegments`, `removed`). **Absent means not analysed, which is not the same as analysed-and-clean** — a driver reading absent as clean would report a recording as unaffected that was never looked at. In-app the verdict travels as `EchoVerdict` (`notMeasured`/`clean`/`affected`), a three-case enum for exactly that reason.
- **Embedding quarantine.** On an affected recording `EchoEmbeddingQuarantine` holds the mic track's embeddings back from `speakers.json`, because `SpeakerMatcher` folds a confirmed embedding into a running-mean centroid with no history — a voice learned from contaminated audio is learned permanently, and every later meeting is matched against it. The filter sits in `SpeakerNamingSession.reapplySpeakerNames`, the single point where a job's embeddings reach the DB (the dialog and `POST /v1/jobs/<id>/naming` both land there) and the last point where the `M_`/`R_` track prefix is still readable — `SpeakerMatcher.updateDB` sees labels but never parses them, and skips any label with no embedding, so dropping the entry is the whole mechanism. The app track stays admissible: the bleed travels loudspeaker → mic, so a remote participant named on an affected recording is still learned. If a dual-source job's labels carry *no* prefix, one track's diarization failed and the pipeline fell back to the other alone; which one is unrecoverable there, so everything is held. The verdict is read from `PipelineJob.echo`, which is the single stored copy and survives a restart in the pipeline snapshot; `EchoVerdict` is derived from it at the point of use and never persisted a second time, so a late re-diarization cannot leave a stale copy behind. **Not covered, by construction:** voice enrollment (Settings → Speakers) can be pointed at a single hand-picked file, including the `_mic.wav` of an affected recording, and a lone file has no second track to correlate against — the quarantine protects the pipeline's own naming path, not every route into `speakers.json`.
- **Transcript dedup (the defect #581 names in its title).** On a recording the detector called affected, `EchoSegmentClassifier` decides per microphone segment whether the app track explains its energy: it reads one loudspeaker-to-microphone gain from a low, app-energy-weighted quantile of blockwise mic/app envelope ratios over the stretches where the far end is playing (not a least-squares fit — local speech only ever adds energy, so an averaging fit is biased upward one-sidedly and an inflated gain "explains" a soft local speaker away), predicts the microphone envelope, and looks at the residual. Alignment comes from the detector's own per-window lag measurement (`EchoBleedDetector.Result.windowScores`), falling back to `micDelay`: the file-start offset alone misses the acoustic path, and a Bluetooth speaker's 100–200 ms would silently no-op the whole dedup. Explained means a copy (`.echoOnly`), leftover energy means someone spoke (`.mixed`/`.ownVoice`). `mergeDualSourceSegments` marks the copies `suppressed` and `[TimestampedSegment].transcriptText` leaves them out, so the far end is written once. **The decision is acoustic on purpose:** a far end replaying what you just said produces the same two transcript lines as a loudspeaker bleeding into the microphone, so text similarity would delete the user's own sentence — measured on a real call. **Marked, not deleted:** the segments stay in the stored data (words recoverable, diarization still sees the timing); an earlier attempt that removed *audio* ate local words under double talk. Gated on the `.affected` verdict, so no lines are removed on a recording the user was told nothing about; the cost is that a recording too short for a verdict keeps its duplicates. `echo.suppressedSegments` on `GET /v1/jobs/<id>` reports the count, and is the only machine-readable evidence that anything was removed. **The safety argument above has a measured hole:** the one-sided gain quantile does not save a soft local speaker once the detector's measured lag is threaded in, which is the only way production calls this, and a speaker at 0.6 of the bleed is explained away and removed. `EchoSegmentClassifierTests` pins it as an expected failure. Tightening `echoResidualCeiling` does not repair it: a true copy through a real room leaves more unexplained energy than a soft interjector does, so lowering the ceiling stops removing real copies before it starts protecting a speaker. Cancellation supersedes the dedup where both are on, but that defends nobody who enabled the dedup alone, and cancellation is off by default too, so the dedup stays off until this is repaired or it goes with the cancellation landing.
- Only the opening `PipelineQueue.echoBleedAnalysisSeconds` of a recording are analysed, so the warning names the span it looked at instead of claiming the whole recording. Bleed starting later is not seen; that is a known limit, not an oversight.
- E2E cover: `scripts/e2e-app.sh --echo-bleed` and `--echo-cancel` (see the `e2e-architecture` skill).

**Echo cancellation, default off:** `EchoCancelling` / `LocalVQECanceller` sit over the vendored LocalVQE static library (`CLocalVQE`, a checksum-pinned `binaryTarget(url:)` against our own vendor release, since upstream ships no macOS artifact). `AppSettings.echoCancellationEnabled` (off) wires it into `transcribeDualSource`, between the detector and transcription.
- **`EchoRemedy` decides which of the two remedies a recording gets, and they do not compose.** Cancellation removes the far end from the microphone *audio*; the dedup drops microphone *transcript* lines that duplicate it. Under cancellation the dedup would be judging audio the far end is already out of, where its measure no longer means what it was calibrated to mean. `intended` is what the settings ask for (cancellation wins), `applied` is what the recording actually got — resolved from the *outcome*, because a cancellation that did not happen leaves the track exactly as recorded and the dedup's reason for standing down goes with it. Deciding it from the settings alone meant a user with both switches on and a missing model got neither remedy.
- **`EchoCancellationSelfCheck` judges the run before its output is adopted**, from the canceller's own per-window report. The measured failure it exists for: on a minority of recordings the model removes essentially nothing while completing normally and writing a full-length track. The check is a **difference** between the windows carrying far-end audio and the windows carrying none, not a level — a run that simply halves the microphone passes a level test and leaves the echo exactly as audible relative to the local voice. It needs both populations, so a far end that never pauses comes back `indeterminate` rather than confirmed, and a one-sided floor keeps a run that *amplifies* the quiet windows from reading as a large difference.
- The cancelled track replaces `mic_16k.wav` **in place**, by renames whose failure states are written out (not `replaceItemAt`, whose behaviour on throw is undocumented). In place because everything downstream opens that path by convention: transcription, the per-track diarization, and the speaker embeddings taken from it.
- `echo.removed` on `GET /v1/jobs/<id>` is the only machine-readable evidence, and is three-state: absent (the stage was never reached), `false` (reached, far end still in the track), `true`. The middle one is the population a field soak counts, and it covers four causes (no model, a throw, an unconfirmed self-check, an output that could not be moved into place) which the job's `warnings` tell apart in prose.
- **The model ships in the bundle, and only there.** `scripts/fetch-localvqe-model.sh` pins the ~2.9 MB `.gguf` by HuggingFace revision *and* SHA-256 and caches it under `~/Library/Caches/MeetingTranscriber/models` (shared across worktrees); `scripts/lib/localvqe-resources.sh` installs it plus its Apache-2.0 licence text into `Contents/Resources`, and is sourced by **both** `build_release.sh` (fatal on failure) and `run_app.sh` (warns, so an unreachable download does not block unrelated dev work). Bundled rather than downloaded on first use because 2.9 MB does not justify a consent dialog, an offline failure mode or first-run latency — a deliberate asymmetry against WhisperKit and FluidAudio, whose ~1 GB does download. Redistributing the weights is what makes the licence copy mandatory (Apache-2.0 4a), so the two are installed together; `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` records the provenance and states plainly that it does not yet cover the statically linked source dependencies.
- **Nothing restates the model filename.** The fetch script is the only pin. `LocalVQEModel` matches by `localvqe-` prefix plus `gguf` extension and the build scripts use the path the fetch script printed, so a model bump is one edit. A name restated in Swift would be a second pin with no way to notice the first moved: the bump would leave every unit test green and resolve to `.absent` in the shipped app.
- **`LocalVQEModel.resolve` refuses one thing deliberately.** An override (`MEETINGTRANSCRIBER_LOCALVQE_MODEL`) naming a missing file resolves to `.overrideMissing` and yields no path, **not** a fallback to the bundled model. The override exists to run one specific model, so silently substituting another would invalidate every measurement taken afterwards. The model is not in the repository, so a plain `swift build`/`swift test` has none and model-dependent tests skip.
- **It does not compose with `AudioMixer.suppressEcho`**, the RMS gate that already runs inside `AudioMixer.mix`: that one mutes the microphone while the app track is loud and so removes the local speaker along with the echo, this one removes the echo acoustically and leaves the speaker. A consumer has to pick, not chain them.
- **`--localvqe-selftest` and the entry point.** `@main` is `AppLauncher`, not `MeetingTranscriberApp`, so a probe launch can divert before `AppState` (and its live-caption prewarm) is constructed. The flag is `#if !APPSTORE` like the debug RPC server, but unlike it has no second runtime gate: it is argv-only, prints and exits. `scripts/localvqe-bundle-check.sh` drives it to prove the static archive resolves its compute backends from `Contents/MacOS` of a signed bundle, which a SwiftPM test build cannot show. That script is **not** wired into any gate yet, so it is run by hand.


**VAD preprocessing:**
- `FluidVAD` wraps FluidAudio Silero v6 for voice activity detection. When enabled (`AppSettings.vadEnabled`), silence is trimmed before transcription and timestamps are remapped back to the original timeline via `VadSegmentMap`.
- `PipelineQueue` holds a cached `FluidVAD` instance (reused across jobs). Pass `vadConfig: nil` to disable.

**Restoring an interrupted job:**
- `ProtocolResumePolicy.decide(interruptedIn:transcriptExists:hasNamingSlug:hasProtocol:)` is the pure decision the snapshot restore makes for a job it found mid-run: `.resumeProtocolOnly` generates the protocol from the transcript already on disk, `.finish` only applies the terminal transition, `.fullRun` re-runs everything.
- **It keys on the stage the job was interrupted in, never on "a transcript exists":** `saveTranscriptDraft` writes one in stage 1, so a job killed during diarization has a draft without speaker labels, and resuming from it would publish that draft. Only `.generatingProtocol` means the transcript on disk is the finished one. A late re-diarization therefore runs in full by design: its transcript is the segmentation the user asked to redo.
- The marking is the snapshot state itself, held in memory as `protocolResumeDispositions` for the span of one restore. Nothing is persisted: a quit before the resume runs degrades to a full run rather than losing anything, and a second persisted field would have to be kept in step with the state it was derived from.
- Why it is not merely a saving: a late confirm transits `.generatingProtocol` too, so a full run there re-diarizes, discards the names the user just confirmed and parks the job back in the dialog they just closed.

**Protocol generation:**
- `ProtocolGenerating` protocol with two implementations: `ClaudeCLIProtocolGenerator` and `OpenAIProtocolGenerator`.
- `AppSettings.protocolProvider` enum (`.claudeCLI` / `.openAICompatible` / `.none`) selects the provider. `.none` skips LLM generation and saves the transcript only.
- `AppSettings.protocolLanguage` string (default `"German"`) is substituted into the prompt as `{LANGUAGE}`. `{MEETING_DATE}` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and `{MEETING_TIME}` (`HH:mm`) resolve from a captured recording start time, or to `Unknown` for imports and recovery jobs. Only a captured recording start adds the authoritative meeting-metadata preamble, so processing time is never presented as a meeting time.
- `ProtocolGenerator.loadPrompt()` loads custom prompt from `AppPaths.customPromptFile` (`~/Library/Application Support/MeetingTranscriber/protocol_prompt.md`), falls back to built-in default.
- `OpenAIProtocolGenerator` supports any OpenAI-compatible HTTP API (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, etc.).
- **Transcript output options** (Settings → Output): `AppSettings.includeFullTranscriptInProtocol` (append the verbatim transcript to the generated Markdown) and `AppSettings.saveRawTranscriptSeparately` (keep the standalone `.txt`) both default to `true` for backward compatibility, and are captured per job at enqueue time so a settings change mid-queue doesn't retroactively affect jobs already running. The raw transcript is retained regardless of the setting whenever protocol generation is disabled, fails, or the job ends in an error — losing the only transcription is worse than an unwanted file.

**UI:**
- `MenuBarIcon` renders animated waveform reflecting pipeline state (idle, recording, transcribing, diarizing, protocol).
- `AppPickerView` enables manual recording of any app via app picker.
- `UpdateChecker` checks GitHub releases for newer versions, shows badge on menu bar icon.
- **`SpeakerNamingView` keys the name fields and the expanded known-names rows by speaker label, never by row position (issue #700).** The name field is a plain SwiftUI `TextField`, which takes a fresh binding on every update. It used to be an `NSViewRepresentable` whose coordinator kept the binding it was created with for the row's whole life, so a binding captured by position went stale when a surviving label moved to another sorted position: it wrote the user's typing into another row and trapped once `names` had fewer entries than that index. That representable existed only so an accessibility set-value (AppleScript `set value of text field`) could drive the field; the automation API (`/v1/jobs/<id>/naming`) took that over, so it was removed rather than armed against the hazard (issue #702). **Which switch reproduces it was measured, and only one does:** switching between two still-pending jobs with the segmented picker keeps the fields, while *completing* the first job does not, because `speakerNamingPicker` is gated on `pendingSpeakerNamingJobs.count > 1` and dropping it changes the enclosing `VStack`'s structure, so SwiftUI rebuilds the form with fresh fields. A Re-run keeps the slot too. `SpeakerNamingFieldIdentityTests` hosts the view in a real `NSWindow` (ViewInspector cannot instantiate a reused field), locates each row by the seed value it shows, and proves the typed name reaches that row's binding by committing the edit (resigning first responder re-reads each field from its binding). `scripts/e2e-app.sh --naming-switch` drives the same switch in the shipped app. Both row-keyed values live in `SpeakerNamingRowState`, one `@Observable` object rather than two `@State` values, which is what lets `SpeakerNamingRowWritesTests` assert *which* row a chip tap or a "More…" press wrote to instead of only that the action ran.

**Permission health check:**
- `PermissionHealthCheck` verifies each TCC permission by combining the system verdict with a live probe. Each resolves to `PermissionStatus` (`.healthy | .denied | .broken | .notDetermined`). `.broken` means TCC says allowed but the probe disagrees — fix is to toggle the permission off and on in System Settings. The Accessibility probe is a cross-process call, so only `kAXErrorAPIDisabled` counts as `.broken`; `.success` and `.noValue` are `AccessibilityProbe.responded`, and every other AXError is `.inconclusive` and reports healthy. Treating those as broken produced a notification telling users to toggle a permission that was working. `kAXErrorNotImplemented` stays inconclusive on purpose: Apple documents it as the asked process lacking AX support. The raw code is appended to `/tmp/mt-permission.log`, which `debugLog` truncates per process.
- `WatchLoop` runs the check on startup; `AppState` re-runs on app activation.
- When unhealthy: `MenuBarIcon` composites a red "!" badge over the current icon (non-template, stays red in dark mode). `BadgeKind.compute()` returns `.error` when idle with a problem. A deduped notification is posted via `NotificationManager`.

**Debug RPC server (dev-only):**
- `DebugRPCServer` is an embedded HTTP server bound to `127.0.0.1:9876` that exposes app state, screenshots, and scene actions for shell-driven inspection. Whole file is `#if !APPSTORE`. Two enable paths: persistent `Settings → Advanced → Local Automation API` toggle (key `debugRPCEnabled`, off by default), or per-session `MEETINGTRANSCRIBER_DEBUG_RPC=1` env var (force-starts at launch). `AppState.applyDebugRPCSetting()` reconciles the running server with both signals at startup and on toggle changes.
- Debug / inspection endpoints (no stability contract): `GET /state` (pipeline + speaker DB + engine state JSON; `engines.*.modelState` lets driver scripts wait for model preload), `GET /healthz`, `GET /metrics` (cumulative CPU/RAM/instructions self-report via `proc_pid_rusage` — diff two snapshots for window averages; process-only, child processes excluded; consumed by `scripts/e2e-cpu-load.sh`), `GET /screenshot` (PNG of the largest visible window), `GET /ui/tree` (read-only accessibility tree of an allowlisted window as JSON — `?window=settings` by default; walks the app's own self-pid `AXUIElement` tree in-process — which surfaces SwiftUI's `.accessibilityIdentifier`s, unlike the `NSView.accessibilityChildren()` walk — and needs no Accessibility TCC grant since self-inspection is exempt; lets a driver assert on UI structure instead of pixel-diffing a screenshot; PII windows stay off the allowlist), `POST /action/confirmBrowserConsent` (resolve a parked browser-meeting consent prompt without a clickable notification, issue #503; body `{granted:bool}` → `{"resolved":true}` if a prompt was waiting, `{"resolved":false}` no-op otherwise; resolves inline via the lock-guarded `ConsentPromptCoordinator`, no main-actor hop — used by `scripts/e2e-browser.sh` via `mt-cli confirm-browser-consent`), `POST /ui/press` (drive a real UI action: presses the control with the given accessibility `identifier` in an allowlisted window via in-process `AXUIElementPerformAction(kAXPressAction)` on the self-pid tree — no TCC grant, runs on the main actor; body `{window, identifier}`; the pressable set is a reviewed per-identifier allowlist, not "any control in the window", so a token-holder can't trigger arbitrary or modal-opening controls; 200 `{"dispatched":<bool>}` (named for dispatch, not effect — the flag is true whenever the actuation ran, so assert `/state`) / 404 allowlisted id absent from tree / 409 present-but-disabled / 403 disallowed window or identifier / 503 window not open; the driver asserts the resulting state via `GET /state`, not the returned flag), `POST /action/openSettings`, `POST /action/closeSettings`.
- Versioned automation API under `/v1` (carries a stability contract, kept off the debug `/action/*` surface): `POST /v1/transcribe` (blocking one-call: 200 terminal / 202 still-running / 400), `POST /v1/jobs` + `GET /v1/jobs/<id>` (enqueue + poll), `GET`/`POST /v1/jobs/<id>/naming` + `POST /v1/jobs/<id>/naming/skip` (speaker naming; 409 on wrong state, 404 unknown id). The two POST enqueue routes honour an `Idempotency-Key` header. Finished-job readback survives the 60s queue reaping + an app restart via `TerminalJobStore`. `GET`/`POST /v1/watch` and `GET`/`POST /v1/record` expose meeting-watching and microphone-only recording as idempotent resources (`{"action":"start"|"stop"|"toggle"}`, `start`/`stop` preferred over `toggle` since a toggle applies a delta to state the caller can't see reliably) — the surface behind Stream Deck/hotkey control (`docs/stream-deck.md`); routed through `WatchingController+WatchControl.swift` / `WatchingController+RecordControl.swift`. Full reference: `docs/automation-api.md`. Routing in `DebugRPCServer+V1.swift`.
- Two-layer auth: 32-byte hex bearer token at `~/Library/Application Support/MeetingTranscriber/.rpc-token` (chmod 0600) + reject on any non-empty browser `Origin` header.
- Action endpoints post `Notification.Name.showSettings` / `.closeSettings` that the `@main` scene observes and routes to `bringWindowToFront(id: "settings")` / `closeWindow(id: "settings")` — same path the menu bar uses.
- `tools/mt-cli` is the matching CLI client; `scripts/test_rpc.sh` is a live end-to-end smoketest. In-process integration tests live in `Tests/DebugRPCServerIntegrationTests.swift` (real sockets via OS-assigned port exposed through `DebugRPCServer.boundPort`).

**Record-only mode:**
- When `AppSettings.recordOnly` is true, `WatchLoop.enqueueRecording()` moves the dual-source WAVs into `<settings.effectiveOutputDir>/recordings/` and writes a `<basename>_meta.json` `RecordingSidecar` next to them, skipping the entire post-processing pipeline (VAD, transcription, diarization, protocol generation). Both call sites — auto-detected meetings (`handleMeeting`) and manual recordings (`stopManualRecording`) — flow through the same branch. The destination is wrapped in `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` to honour user-picked Output Folder bookmarks (relevant for the App Store sandboxed build).
- Sidecar JSON contains: `version` (currently `RecordingSidecar.currentVersion = 2`), `title`, `appName`, `startedAt`/`stoppedAt` (ISO 8601, reconstructed from `recordingStart` uptime), `participants`, `micDelaySeconds`, `trigger`, `files` (basenames only). Optional `app` / `mic` filenames are omitted when nil.
Suffix constants live as static lets: the audio-file suffixes on `RecordingFileSuffix` (`mix = "_mix.wav"`, `app`, `mic`, and the raw-temp `appRaw`/`legacyAppRaw`), and the sidecar suffix on `RecordingSidecar.filenameSuffix = "_meta.json"`.
- `trigger` (`auto` | `manual`, added in version 2) says which call site produced the recording, so a fleet consumer can discard a very short *auto* capture as a false trigger while always processing an equally short *manual* one — duration alone cannot tell those apart. A browser meeting is `auto`: the detector initiates it and the consent prompt only gates it. Every field added after version 1 must decode as optional, because `RecordingSidecar.read` is a `try?` and one unrecognised value would otherwise discard the *entire* sidecar on the reimport path.
- Intended for fleet topologies where macOS clients capture and a separate machine (e.g. Linux GPU host) processes the audio via Syncthing or similar.
- Menu bar: the small red dot is rendered as a **persistent overlay** (`MenuBarIcon.image(..., recordOnlyOverlay:)`) on top of *whatever* primary badge `BadgeKind.compute(...)` would otherwise show — idle, recording, transcribing, etc. — so the mode is always visible. Permission overlay (red exclamation) takes precedence when both apply, since a permission problem actually breaks recording. Settings tabs dim Transcription / Protocol / VAD / Diarization sections via `View.recordOnlyDisabled(_:)` and show a banner in the General tab pointing at the active output dir.
- Sidecar write failures notify the user via `NotificationManager` (injected as `any AppNotifying` on `WatchLoop`) since record-only does not transition state to `.error`.

**Output folder fallback:** when the chosen output folder's bookmark stops resolving (unplugged drive, unmounted share, deleted folder), output goes to `~/Downloads/MeetingTranscriber` and the user is told once. `AppSettings.outputDirectoryResolution` says which happened (`.defaultLocation` / `.custom` / `.fallback`, the last one naming the chosen path read from the bookmark bytes); `effectiveOutputDir` is its URL and stays a pure read. `OutputDirectoryResolver` (owned by `PipelineController`, shared with `WatchingController`) is the only thing that notifies, and it is called only where a destination is captured: `PipelineController.makeQueue()` (by value, for every job the queue runs) and the record-only destination closure (per write). Once per episode, keyed on the bookmark; a folder that resolves again or a new choice re-arms it. Views and the poll must never call `resolve()`. `AppSettings.init(defaultOutputDir:)` exists so tests can point the fallback away from the real Downloads folder; a test that resolves to the production default is one step from writing into it.

## Critical Notes

- AudioTapLib (CATapDescription) requires macOS 14.2+ — compiled as SPM library, no separate binary needed
- **Meeting detection** needs no Screen Recording: the watch loop auto-detects via `CompositeMeetingDetector` over `PowerAssertionDetector` (IOKit power assertions) and `MicInputDetector` (Core Audio process objects), neither of which reads window titles. The grant only sharpens the meeting *title* (`CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`, real title vs. a placeholder) and gates the audio-tap TCC fallback below. The window-title `MeetingDetector` that would require it is not the production detector (issue #562).
- Audio capture (CATapDescription process tap) is TCC-gated: it needs either the `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` "Audio Recording" grant or, as a fallback, the Screen Recording grant. With neither, the tap returns `noErr` but captures silence, with no error and nothing logged (issue #524; measured on macOS 26, see the process-tap TCC-gate notes). This corrects an earlier "does not require Screen Recording" claim.
- FluidAudio models are downloaded automatically on first run (~50 MB)

## GUI Testing

Rule: test each behavior at the cheapest layer that can falsify it.

1. **Pure logic first.** Extract decision logic into a value type
   (`BadgeKind.compute`, `LiveCaptionsGate`, `WatchLoopEndPolicy` pattern) and put
   the bulk of assertions there.
2. **ViewInspector** (`swift test`, every PR): exactly one wiring test per control —
   find by its `A11yID` constant (see Identifiers), drive
   (`.tap()`/`.select()`/`.increment()`),
   assert the `AppSettings` write-back. Don't enumerate logic states through the view;
   that's layer 1's job. (ViewInspector is reflection over undocumented SwiftUI
   internals — keep to the boring primitives; breakage is loud since it runs on
   every PR.)
   **A tap that writes state the view keeps is assertable only when that state
   is a reference type** (a tap that calls a callback is assertable either way,
   and most are). The tap runs the action regardless, but a `@State` mutation
   lands in the copy SwiftUI made for that body evaluation, so the next
   `inspect()` still reads the old value. Hosting does not change that: measured with
   `ViewHosting.host` and with a real `NSHostingView` in a real window, both of
   which host a copy, and ViewInspector's own way around it wants an `Inspection`
   hook inside the view's body, which is a test-only affordance in shipping code.
   Where a form's mutable state is worth asserting, hold it in one `@Observable`
   object (`SpeakerNamingRowState` is the worked example) and the object the test
   holds is the object the action writes to. Without that, a chip or toggle test
   can only say the action ran, never where the write landed.
3. **`/state` (live RPC):** first choice for live assertions, including window/scene
   behavior via `/state.windows` (`isVisible` after deactivate, `floating`,
   `canJoinAllSpaces` — how #509/#511 guard the naming-window pin).
4. **`/ui/tree` + `/ui/press` + `/ui/type`** (live, Settings window only): only for behavior that
   exists solely in the real AppKit/AX layer. A live test earns its keep only when
   ViewInspector cannot instantiate the failing layer (real NSWindow/NSPanel,
   focus/activation, scene routing, the NSHostingView boundary, actual AX exposure).
5. **Snapshots** (dev-only, `XCTSkipIf(isCI)`): pixel truth; never CI-gated.

**Identifiers:** add `.accessibilityIdentifier` on demand via the shared `A11yID`
namespace (`Sources/A11yID.swift`) — the view modifier, the ViewInspector `find`, and
the `/ui/press` allowlist all reference the constant so the compiler catches drift.
Interaction tests locate by the `A11yID` constant, `Picker` and `Stepper`
included. Both are findable by an identifier attached to the control itself, in
two steps, because the lookup returns the modified view rather than the typed
control and the second `find` is what makes `select`/`increment` reachable:

```swift
let picker = try view.inspect()
    .find(viewWithAccessibilityIdentifier: A11yID.liveCaptionsSizePicker)
    .find(ViewType.Picker.self)
try picker.select(value: LiveCaptionsSize.small)
```

Measured under the pinned ViewInspector 0.10.3, and pinned by
`ViewInspectorIdentifierTests`: a `Picker` and a `Stepper` each carrying an
identifier are found and driven, and an unknown identifier throws, so the lookup
is not matching whatever it is handed. This replaces an earlier note here that
claimed neither control surfaces a findable identifier. The label and
document-order locators still in `SettingsInteractionTests` date from that
belief; they work, and they are not the shape to copy. `find(text:)` for a bare
label only when the label itself is the behavior under test. An identifier makes a control
tree-visible;
press-drivable *additionally* requires a `/ui/press` allowlist entry — never allowlist
a control whose action opens a menu/popover/sheet/panel (a nested runloop wedges the
app, see `DebugRPCServer+UIPress.swift`). Never widen the window allowlist to PII
windows or expose control values (`DebugRPCServer+UITree.swift`).

**Live assertions:** assert the `/state` effect, never the returned `pressed` flag or
tree structure (depth/frames/child counts). Assert the env-stable, load-bearing pin
subset (`isVisible`, `floating`, `canJoinAllSpaces`) — `fullScreenAuxiliary` proved
env-unstable on the CI mini (#511). `e2e-ui-smoke` is a harness-liveness canary only —
feature-level live assertions go in `test_rpc.sh` or the `e2e-app` lanes.

**GUI bug found:** failing test first, at the lowest layer that reproduces it. If only
the live scene reproduces, drive the real scene window (a minimal probe window does not
reproduce — #504). Acceptance: revert the fix, test goes red.

**Don't:** chase snapshot coverage; use `/ui/press` to arrange state (it's for testing
the pressed control); test SwiftUI framework behavior (e.g. that `.keyboardShortcut`
fires). **Manual-QA-only, accepted:** menu-bar dropdown interaction, modal panels
(NSOpenPanel/NSAlert), TCC prompts, drag/focus order, visual appearance beyond dev-only
snapshots.

**A self-pid accessibility tree is not a unit-test locator: it is empty behind
the lock screen.** Measured on macOS 26: with the screen locked, HIServices
answers every window query on the app's own `AXUIElement` with the application
element itself and serves no SwiftUI element, so a SwiftUI
`.accessibilityIdentifier` is unreachable there even though it is present when
unlocked; `NSApplication.finishLaunching()` does not change this, and neither the
backing `NSTextField` nor its cell ever carries the identifier. A unit test that
finds controls through the AX tree is green at an unlocked desk and red on an
unattended or locked runner. Locate hosted controls by their `NSView` state
instead (`SpeakerNamingFieldIdentityTests` finds a name field by the seed value
it shows). The AX identifier stays the contract for the out-of-process drivers
(`/ui/*`, `scripts/drive-naming-field.swift`), which run against a live, unlocked
app rather than xctest.

**Escape resists injection, and the reason shapes how Escape must be bound.** A
hand-built `NSEvent` with keycode 53 does not reach SwiftUI's `onExitCommand`:
tried via `NSWindow.sendEvent` in xctest, and in the live app via both
`NSWindow.sendEvent` and `NSApplication.sendEvent` with the window made key and
the app activated — all report a clean dispatch and change nothing. The
mechanism: keycode 53 becomes `cancelOperation:` only inside
`interpretKeyEvents:`, which only text-input responders call, so with no field
focused AppKit's fallback emits `cancel:` instead, which `onExitCommand` ignores.
Text injection works precisely because insertion *is* interpreted down there.
Consequence for product code, not just tests: `onExitCommand` alone gives you a
focus-dependent Escape, so a dialog that must always dismiss on Escape also needs
a `.keyboardShortcut(.cancelAction)` carrier, which rides the focus-independent
key-equivalent pass (`SpeakerNamingView.escapeDismissShortcut`). A physical Escape is
drivable only from outside the process, via a WindowServer keystroke: that is what
`scripts/e2e-app.sh --naming-escape` does, and it is why that lane (alone) needs an
Accessibility grant on the runner. Below that layer, ViewInspector pins the handler
wiring and `/state` pins the resulting window/job state.

**Typing** is automatable via `POST /ui/type` (allowlisted plain text fields only —
never a `SecureField`). It posts real key events, because an AX set-value does *not*
fire the SwiftUI binding; that asymmetry is why there is no `/ui/setValue`. Pass
`clear: true` to replace rather than append, or the assertion depends on the field's
prior contents. Reaching a control outside the General tab needs a tab switch first,
and only `POST /ui/press` with `"via": "click"` performs one — the AX press reports
success on a sidebar row without selecting it.

## E2E Architecture

Two complementary E2E approaches (fixture-based xctest `e2e.yml`, live-recording
`e2e-app.yml`/`scripts/e2e-app.sh`, and browser-meeting `e2e-browser.yml` incl. the
`--jitsi` real-meeting variant), the CI trigger labels (`run-e2e`/`run-quality`), when
to pick each, why the live-recording variant exists, and the one-time self-hosted Mac
mini runner setup → see the `e2e-architecture` skill (`.claude/skills/e2e-architecture/`).
Read it before touching the E2E workflows, `scripts/e2e-app.sh`, `scripts/e2e-browser.sh`,
the naming-confirm lane, or runner configuration.

## Diagnostics

`AppSettings.verboseDiagnostics` (Settings → Diagnostics → "Verbose Audio Logging"; renamed from the legacy `audioDebugLogging` key, which is migrated on read) enables forensic logging in the audio-capture path:

- `[debug] Tap target: pid=… exe=… bundle=… audioObjectID=…` at start
- `[debug] Default output device: name=… uid=… transport=… rate=…` at start and on device change
- `[debug] Output device change → name=… uid=…` when system output device changes mid-capture
- `[debug] App audio RMS (5s): … dBFS, samples=…, totalBytes=…` every 5 s during capture — live signal whether the tap is delivering real audio or zero/noise
- `[debug] App audio capture stopping: totalBytes=…` at stop
- `[debug] Mic input device: name=… uid=… hwRate=… hwChannels=…` at mic capture start — the microphone the recording comes from: the device `AppSettings.micDeviceUID` pins when the pin took or could not be disproved, and the **system default input** when it demonstrably did not (nothing configured, the device absent, the set refused, or the unit answering with another device). A set that was accepted and could not be read back keeps naming the configured device: the acceptance is the only evidence there is, and falling back there would state the opposite of what was measured. It used to resolve the system default in every case, so with a device pinned it named a microphone that was not recording (issue #724). **Do not "fix" this to report the device the input unit is bound to.** Measured on macOS 26: with nothing pinned, `AVAudioEngine` binds its input unit not to the microphone but to a private aggregate of its own, `CADefaultDeviceAggregate-<n>-0`, which follows the system default. Reporting that is strictly worse than the bug, because the question the line exists for is "built-in or headset". The unit is still read back, but as a watchdog on the pin, not as the identity.
- `[debug] Mic RMS (5s): … dBFS, samples=…` every 5 s during mic capture — `samples` counts at the **hardware** rate and across **all channels** (`frames * hwChannels`), not the 16 kHz mono written to the file. So `samples / (interval * hwChannels)` is a second, independent reading of the **capture rate**. That is corroboration, not identity: it separated the built-in mic (48 kHz) from AirPods in headset mode (24 kHz) in the incident this comes from, but two devices can share a rate and a device's rate is not fixed, so it narrows the candidates rather than naming one. Omitting the channel divisor is how a stereo 24 kHz input reads as 48 kHz and gets mistaken for the built-in mic, which is the exact confusion this is used to settle.

**Unconditional** (not behind the toggle), because a silent-track report cannot be triaged by asking the user to have enabled logging beforehand, and because these are bounded rather than per-buffer (issue #672):

- `App audio tap: N PID(s) [names]` at start
- `System output device: … transport=…` at start
- `App audio process state (start|zero run started|stop): exe=… pid=… object=… isRunningOutput=… outputDevices=…` — one line per tapped process. `isRunningOutput` separates a dead tap from a process that rendered nothing; it does **not** separate a silent far end from a dead tap, because a stream rendering zeroes still reports true. `outputDevices` says whether the process's output went to the output device or into some other device (a voice-processing aggregate, say) that the tap does not follow.
- `App audio device (start|zero run started|stop): aggregate=… running=… defaultOutput=… defaultOutputRate=…` — one line per probe, from the same snapshot as the process-state lines. `running` is the aggregate's `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunning`: `AudioDeviceStart` returning `noErr` says the object exists, not that IO runs, and no other line separates the two, so a report of "the tap was created and no buffer ever arrived" is otherwise undecidable (issue #693). The default output device's object id and nominal rate come from **one** read, so they always describe the same device: the aggregate binds its sub-device by UID, and a Bluetooth headset can change rate under it without the default output device changing, which nothing else notices. A failed read renders `?(status)` and never as a plausible value.
- `App audio: track has been at exact zeros for … s while buffers keep arriving` on entering a zero run, and the matching `signal returned after … s` on leaving. Capped at `SilentTrackObserver.maxEdgesPerRecording` edges per recording; the counters keep going past the cap so the stop line stays honest.
- `App audio at stop: bytes=… lastBufferAge=… lastEnergyAge=… zeroRuns=… longestZeroRun=…`. `lastEnergyAge=never` means the channel carried no non-zero sample at all, which is the signature of a tap that was never allowed to hear the app (issue #524), not of one that died.
- `Mic device set: …` / `Mic device not set: …` / `Mic device not adopted: …` at mic capture start, only when `AppSettings.micDeviceUID` pins a device. The status of `AudioUnitSetProperty` used to be discarded and the success wording logged either way, so a refused pin and an accepted one were indistinguishable while the recording ran on a microphone the user had not chosen (issue #724). Four arms now, and the levels differ on purpose. A configured device that is merely absent, and one whose adoption could not be read back, are **default** level (a sleeping headset would otherwise log an error on every recording and bury the rest in the same filter); a refusal (`not set`, carrying the `OSStatus`) and an acceptance the unit did not honour (`not adopted`, carrying the device it is on instead) are **errors**. The last of those is why the read-back exists: `noErr` says the call was accepted, not that the unit moved. **No arm carries the device UID**, and a test enforces that: the line is unconditional, `PersistentDiagnosticLog` streams it to disk, and Settings offers that file as "a redacted log file" whose redaction *is* os_log privacy. An audio device UID is stable across boots and a USB one carries the serial, so it is named only in the verbose-gated `[debug] Mic input device:` line. Nothing acts on any of it yet: it is reported, not retried, and the user is not told.

The process-state reads run on their own queue (`com.meetingtranscriber.audiotap.diagnostics`), never on the write queue: that is the IOProc's delivery queue and `AppTapSession.destroy()` drains it with a `sync`, so a HAL read wedged there would wedge every teardown behind it (issue #588). One read at a time, so a wedged one costs a single parked thread rather than a pile.

View via Console.app, subsystem `com.meetingtranscriber.audiotap`. Off by default; turn on when investigating silent recordings or unusual routing.

## Build Variants

Two build variants controlled by compile-time flag `APPSTORE` (`-Xswiftc -DAPPSTORE`):

| | Homebrew | App Store |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude CLI** | Yes (Process subprocess) | No (sandbox forbids Process) |
| **OpenAI API** | Yes | Yes (only LLM option) |
| **Debug RPC server** | Yes (env-gated) | No (`#if !APPSTORE`) |
| **Safari call audio** | Yes (`ProcessResponsibility` via `dlsym`) | No (private symbol unavailable; bundle-derived PIDs only) |
| **Entitlements** | Mic only | Sandbox + mic + network + file picker |
| **Build** | `./scripts/build_release.sh` | `./scripts/build_release.sh --appstore` |
| **Tests** | ~1,900 | fewer (CLI + RPC tests excluded via `#if !APPSTORE`) |

- CLI-specific code lives in `ClaudeCLIProtocolGenerator.swift` and `DebugRPCServer.swift` (each entire file `#if !APPSTORE`)
- `ProtocolProvider` enum uses `CaseIterable` — `.claudeCLI` case excluded at compile time, picker adapts automatically
- `ProtocolError` has `#if !APPSTORE` around CLI error cases (enum cases cannot be added via extension)
- FFmpegHelper also uses `Process()` but falls back gracefully to `nil` — no `#if` needed
