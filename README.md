# Meeting Transcriber

> **The local-first meeting transcriber for macOS.** Records Teams, Zoom, and Webex calls, transcribes them on-device with Whisper / Parakeet, separates speakers, and turns the result into a Markdown protocol using your own Claude CLI or any local LLM. **No cloud. No subscription. No audio ever leaves your Mac.**

## Why this exists

Cloud meeting recorders (Otter, Fireflies, Granola, tl;dv) work great, until you remember that every word from every meeting goes to a third-party server. For a lot of teams (legal, healthcare, M&A, anything under NDA, or just folks who'd rather not) that's a non-starter.

Meeting Transcriber runs the entire pipeline (recording, transcription, speaker diarization, summarization) on your Mac. No account, no upload, no monthly bill.

| Source available               | No                 | **MIT licensed**        |

## Install

```bash
brew tap pasrom/meeting-transcriber
brew install --cask meeting-transcriber
```

> Homebrew 6.0+ may flag the third-party tap as untrusted. If so, run `brew trust --tap pasrom/meeting-transcriber` before installing.

The app lives in your menu bar — open it, grant microphone + screen-recording permission, and the first detected Teams/Zoom/Webex call records automatically.

## Features

- **Automatic meeting detection** — Recognizes Teams, Zoom, and Webex meetings via window title polling, opt-in browser meeting detection (Google Meet, Whereby, web Zoom/Teams in any Chromium browser) gated behind a recording-consent prompt, and opt-in mic-input detection for call apps without a reliable meeting signal (WeChat, Tencent Meeting, FaceTime, WhatsApp) — per app, off by default, and unlike the browser path it starts recording without a prompt
- **Dual audio recording** — App audio ([CATapDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudio/catap)) + microphone simultaneously
- **On-device transcription** — Two engines, selectable in Settings:
  - [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) — 99+ languages, ~1 GB model; besides the stock models, a custom WhisperKit model can be loaded from another Hugging Face repository or a local folder (see [Custom WhisperKit models](#custom-whisperkit-models))
  - [Parakeet TDT v3](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) (NVIDIA) — 25 EU languages, ~50 MB model, ~10× faster
- **Custom vocabulary & terminology** — One shared vocabulary file boosts recognition of names/jargon on Parakeet (CTC boosting) and, optionally, on WhisperKit (experimental decoder-prompt hint); an independent, opt-in terminology-normalization pass rewrites recognized spelling variants to a canonical form after transcription, regardless of engine
- **On-device speaker diarization** — [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) via CoreML/ANE — no HuggingFace token needed; two modes: standard (`OfflineDiarizer`) and overlap-aware (`Sortformer`)
- **Dual-track diarization** — App and mic tracks diarized separately for clean speaker separation without echo interference
- **Echo bleed handling** — On loudspeaker recordings, remote voices picked up by the microphone are detected automatically and reported. Two optional remedies, both off by default: acoustic echo cancellation removes the bleed from the microphone audio itself, and a transcript dedup leaves the duplicated lines out. The dedup is off because it can mistake a quiet remark made over the far end for echo and drop it
- **Speaker recognition** — Voice embeddings stored across meetings, matched via cosine similarity
- **VAD preprocessing** — Optional silence trimming via FluidAudio Silero v6 before transcription, with automatic timestamp remapping
- **AI protocol generation** — Structured Markdown via [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), OpenAI-compatible APIs (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.), or disabled (save transcript only)
- **Configurable protocol prompt** — Custom prompt file support (`~/Library/Application Support/MeetingTranscriber/protocol_prompt.md`) with `{LANGUAGE}`, `{MEETING_DATE}` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), and `{MEETING_TIME}` (`HH:mm`) variables; recordings include authoritative metadata, while imports and recovery jobs resolve time placeholders to `Unknown`
- **Manual recording** — Record any app via app picker, not just detected meetings
- **Multi-format input** — Supports WAV, MP3, M4A, MP4, FLAC, plus the phone and messenger voice formats AMR, 3GP/3G2 and OPUS/OGG; MKV and WebM additionally need ffmpeg
- **Update checker** — Notifies when a new version is available
- **Background processing** — PipelineQueue runs transcription and protocol generation independently from recording
- **Record-only mode** — Skip the entire post-recording pipeline and drop dual-source recordings + a metadata sidecar into the output folder, for external/fleet processing (e.g. a separate GPU host)
- **Local automation API** (Homebrew build): drive the pipeline headlessly over localhost HTTP. POST an audio file, get a diarized transcript back. See [`docs/automation-api.md`](docs/automation-api.md)
- **Stream Deck and hotkey control** (Homebrew build): start/stop watching from a Stream Deck key, Shortcut, Raycast or any launcher. See [`docs/stream-deck.md`](docs/stream-deck.md)
- **Distribution** — Install via Homebrew Cask or build from source

---

## Prerequisites

- macOS 14.2+ (required for CATapDescription audio capture)
- **One of:**
  - [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — installed and logged in (`claude --version`)
  - An OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (e.g. [Ollama](https://ollama.com), LM Studio, llama.cpp) — configure in Settings

No HuggingFace token needed — FluidAudio and WhisperKit download their models automatically on first run.

### Optional: ffmpeg for extra formats

Install ffmpeg to enable MKV and WebM support:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

The app detects ffmpeg automatically. Status is shown in Settings → About.

### Using Ollama as provider

1. Install Ollama: `brew install ollama`
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.1` (or any model that fits your hardware)
3. Start the server: `ollama serve` (runs on `http://localhost:11434` by default)
4. In the app's Settings, select **OpenAI-Compatible API** as provider and set:
   - **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`
   - **Model:** `llama3.1` (must match the pulled model name)

---

## Installation

### Via Homebrew Cask (recommended)

```bash
brew tap pasrom/meeting-transcriber
brew install --cask meeting-transcriber
```

> **Tap trust:** Homebrew 6.0 added [tap trust](https://docs.brew.sh/Tap-Trust) for third-party taps. During the 6.0.x transition non-official taps are still allowed by default (you may just see a warning); enforcement is opt-in via `HOMEBREW_REQUIRE_TAP_TRUST` and becomes mandatory in a later release. If your Homebrew enforces it, run `brew trust --tap pasrom/meeting-transcriber` before `brew install --cask`.

### Pre-release (RC) via Homebrew

```bash
brew tap pasrom/meeting-transcriber
brew install --cask meeting-transcriber@beta
```

> Note: The stable and beta casks conflict — uninstall one before installing the other.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pasrom/meeting-transcriber
cd meeting-transcriber
./scripts/run_app.sh
```

## Permissions

| Permission | Required for | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Screen Recording | Optional — sharpens the meeting *title* and acts as a fallback for the audio tap. Detection itself works without it | System Settings → Privacy & Security |
| Microphone | Mic recording | Prompted on first use |
| Accessibility | Mute detection, participant reading (Teams) | System Settings → Privacy & Security |
| App audio capture | — | No permission needed (purple dot indicator only) |

---

## Menu Bar Icon

The app uses an animated waveform icon in the menu bar that reflects the current pipeline stage:

<p>
<img src="docs/menu-bar-idle.gif" width="80" alt="Idle">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="docs/menu-bar-recording.gif" width="80" alt="Recording">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="docs/menu-bar-transcribing.gif" width="80" alt="Transcribing">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="docs/menu-bar-diarizing.gif" width="80" alt="Diarizing">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="docs/menu-bar-protocol.gif" width="80" alt="Protocol">
</p>

**Idle** → **Recording** (bars bounce) → **Transcribing** (bars morph to text) → **Diarizing** (bars split into groups) → **Protocol** (lines appear sequentially)

### Permission problem badge

<p>
<img src="docs/menu-bar-permission.gif" width="80" alt="Permission problem">
</p>

A red exclamation mark in the bottom-right corner is overlaid on top of the current icon (idle, recording, transcribing, …) whenever one of the required permissions is missing or broken. It means at least one of the following is not in a working state:

- **Microphone** — denied, or granted but the capture engine can't open the device
- **Screen Recording** — denied, or granted but `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` returns no window titles (TCC state out of sync)
- **Accessibility** — denied, or granted but the AX API refuses to read Teams participant/mute info

The health check distinguishes *denied* from *broken*. "Broken" usually means the permission is toggled on in System Settings but macOS hasn't actually wired it through — the fix is to toggle the permission off and on again for Meeting Transcriber under **System Settings → Privacy & Security**. Open the menu bar dropdown to see which specific permission is affected; a notification is also posted when the state changes.

### Record-only mode badge

<p>
<img src="docs/menu-bar-record-only.gif" width="80" alt="Record-only mode">
</p>

A small red dot in the bottom-right corner is overlaid on top of the current icon (idle, recording, transcribing, …) whenever **Record-only mode** is enabled (Settings → General → "Record-only mode"). In this mode the app keeps detecting meetings and producing dual-source recordings, but skips the entire post-recording pipeline (VAD, transcription, diarization, protocol generation). Recordings + a per-meeting `<timestamp>_meta.json` sidecar are dropped into your configured Output Folder for an external pipeline (e.g. a Linux GPU host via Syncthing) to pick up. The dot stays visible across all states so the mode is always clearly indicated; if a permission problem coexists, the red exclamation badge takes precedence.

### Per-channel asymmetric-silence indicator

<p>
<img src="docs/menu-bar-channel-silent-app.gif" width="80" alt="App-audio channel silent — bottom half red">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="docs/menu-bar-channel-silent-mic.gif" width="80" alt="Mic channel silent — top half red">
</p>

When one capture channel goes silent while the other is still carrying audio for longer than the configured debounce window, the waveform bars are tinted red to surface the half-broken capture at a glance:

- **Bottom half red** — app-audio channel is dead (you're speaking but nothing from the meeting app is being captured — bad tap, broken routing, system output muted)
- **Top half red** — mic channel is dead (the meeting is audible but your voice isn't being captured — wrong input device, mic muted at system level)
- **Both halves red** — both channels are silent while in recording state

The tint follows the levels, and **Settings → Audio → Per-Channel Indicator** is what turns it on or off (default: on). Dual dBFS thresholds with hysteresis keep transient dips between syllables from resetting the debounce timer.

Notifications do not follow the tint. A single channel is reported only once it stops delivering, either no buffers at all or buffers carrying nothing but digital zeroes, measured from what the capture layer records per buffer rather than from a level: a microphone whose owner is listening rather than talking is quiet, not broken, and is not reported. The separate "Recording Appears Silent" warning, for the case where *both* channels are quiet, is still decided from levels and can therefore still fire on a call in which nobody is speaking. How long the condition must last first is the **Warn after** slider (30–300 s, default 90 s), which applies whether or not the tint is switched on.

If a permission problem coexists, the red exclamation badge takes precedence over the channel-silent tint.

## Usage

Launch the app — it sits in your menu bar. When a supported meeting is detected, recording starts automatically. When the meeting ends, the pipeline runs in the background: transcription → diarization → protocol generation.

You can also batch-process existing audio and video files via the menu (⌘P) — supported formats: WAV, MP3, M4A, MP4, FLAC, AMR, 3GP/3G2 and OPUS/OGG (and MKV, WebM when ffmpeg is installed). Smartphone call recordings (AMR, 3GP) and voice messages (OPUS) need no extra tools.

---

## Configuration

Open Settings via the menu bar item or ⌘,.

<img src="docs/settings-overview.png" width="600" alt="Settings window">

| Tab | What's in it |
|---|---|
| **General** | Record-only mode, apps to watch (Teams/Zoom/Webex/Browser/WeChat/Tencent Meeting/FaceTime/WhatsApp), detection timing, update checks |
| **Audio** | Microphone device, voice activity detection (VAD), per-channel silence indicator, echo cancellation (off by default) |
| **Transcribe** | ASR engine (WhisperKit / Parakeet) and per-engine options (model incl. a custom WhisperKit model, language, custom vocabulary), terminology normalization rules, live caption overlay (PoC) |
| **Speakers** | Diarization, mic speaker name, known voices, recognition stats |
| **Output** | LLM provider (Claude CLI / OpenAI-compatible / none), transcript-retention options, protocol language, output folder, custom prompt |
| **Advanced** | Permissions status, diagnostics, version info |

### Custom WhisperKit models

Settings → Transcribe → Model → **Custom model…** loads a fine-tuned WhisperKit model instead of a stock one, for example a Swiss German fine-tune. Enter a Hugging Face repository laid out like [`argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml`](https://huggingface.co/argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml) (one folder per variant) plus the variant folder name, e.g. `spert/flix-swissgerman-whisperkit` and `flix-swissgerman-large-v3_8bit`; it downloads on first use and loads offline afterwards. Alternatively choose a model folder on disk: it must contain `AudioEncoder.mlmodelc`, `TextDecoder.mlmodelc`, `MelSpectrogram.mlmodelc`, `tokenizer.json` and `tokenizer_config.json`, and is never downloaded. Until a custom model is filled in, the previously selected stock model is used.

---

## Output

Files are saved to `~/Library/Application Support/MeetingTranscriber/protocols/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `20260225_1400_meeting.txt` | Raw transcript (when enabled) |
| `20260225_1400_meeting.md` | Structured protocol (when an LLM provider is configured) |

In **Settings → Output**, both transcript options default to enabled for backward compatibility:

- **Include full transcript in protocol** appends the verbatim transcript to generated Markdown.
- **Save raw transcript separately** retains the standalone `.txt` file.

Disable both to retain only the generated meeting minutes. The recording follows its own retention policy and is not deleted by either setting. To avoid data loss, a raw transcript is retained if protocol generation is disabled, fails, or the job ends with an error.

**Protocol structure:** Summary, Participants, Topics Discussed, Decisions, Tasks (with responsible person, deadline, priority), Open Questions, and optionally the Full Transcript.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `claude not found` | Install Claude Code CLI, run `claude --version` — or switch to OpenAI-compatible provider in Settings |
| No meeting detected | Check the app is enabled under Settings → General → Apps to Watch. Screen Recording is not required for detection; it only sharpens the meeting title |
| No app audio | Requires macOS 14.2+ for CATapDescription audio capture |
| Empty transcription | Check that the file contains an audio track — the app converts to 16 kHz mono automatically |
| Models not loading | Models download on first run (WhisperKit ~1 GB, Parakeet ~50 MB); check internet connectivity |
| OpenAI-compatible API connection failed | Verify the endpoint URL and that the local model server is running |

### Diagnosing silent app-audio recordings

If a recording's `_app.wav` is silent or unexpectedly quiet, enable verbose audio logging to capture forensic detail during the next attempt:

1. Open **Settings → Diagnostics** and turn on **Verbose Audio Logging**.
2. Reproduce the failing recording.
3. Open **Console.app**, filter by subsystem `com.meetingtranscriber.audiotap`, and look for `[debug]` lines:
   - `[debug] Tap target: pid=… exe=… bundle=… audioObjectID=…` — which process the tap targeted
   - `[debug] Default output device: name=… uid=… transport=… rate=…` — output device at start
   - `[debug] App audio RMS (5s): …dBFS, samples=…, totalBytes=…` — every 5 seconds; **tells you live whether the tap is delivering real audio (-40 dBFS or higher) or near-silence (≤ -90 dBFS)**
   - `[debug] Output device change → name=… uid=…` — emitted when the system output device changes mid-recording
   - `[debug] Mic input device: name=… uid=… hwRate=… hwChannels=…` — mic hardware device at capture start
   - `[debug] Mic RMS (5s): …dBFS, samples=…` — every 5 seconds during mic capture
4. Turn the toggle off again when done — the per-5 s RMS log is moderately chatty.

The toggle persists in `UserDefaults` and takes effect on the next recording without an app restart.
